Ah yes! its exactly 12:00 am of September 1 as I am jotting this blog out. "BER" MONTHS ARE FINALLY HERE WOOHOO!!!

So what if "Ber" months has started you say? not much in particular.... its just that the countdown has started and in 4 months time, this year of bad luck would soon come to an end! yep, I had a bad year. Hopefully this coming year would turn the tides.

Whats great though is that cold weather is finally approaching, exciting isn't it? Soon, I wouldn't worry too much of my hair suffocating me through the heat while commuting to work... yep, i still got that long hair. Its been 3 years since my last haircut and everybody's asking me... "ba't ka ba kase nagpapahaba ng buhok!?" well, then it's time that you get an answer... so here goes:

The reason why I am growing my hair long is because... i like to... i got a couple of special reasons but I guess I can just put it this way, my hair is some sort of a reminder for me to always finish what I've started. I had sworn an oath to grow my hair for 5 years and then take a picture with it... probably naked! hehe. Some weird oath but I've always intended to accomplish it. Pepper also likes my hair long so... there ya go! You may also think of me as a guy so lazy he can't even get the time to have a haircut... hehe

Anyways, its great to have September up. In 4 days, my mom would be celebrating her 53rd birthday I would have to prepare for a lot of cooking by then. I simply feel this last quarter would be better that I expect it to be, since I am starting to feel like this year has given me so muck bad luck already.

It also feels great having been able to blog again. As you can see, I had this site up again for that exact purpose. I may also post this on my Multiply blog soon but I guess it would rather stay here first. got lots of things to blog about, but I needed a jump start so I decided to post a blog with a random idea. I basically blogged what came across my mind when I thought about posting. and well... enough talk. It's great to be back blogging.
