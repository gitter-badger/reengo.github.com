My sister had slept during her board exams for nursing... she answered randomly 200 questions with the 30 minutes that was left as she wakes up... at first I thought of it as a joke. but I was wrong.

This morning we had an argument, yes I understand that she had pushed herself to the limits reviewing to the very end. but you really wont ever know what will happen even if you're dead sure you have prepared for something to the tiniest detail. There is no one to blame, yes, but I do think that I have all the right in the world to get disappointed!

Rin: "so kelan yung results?"
Sis:  "September pa..."
Rin: "Ayun, mag hanap ka na ng work habang naghihintay ka! ngaun na!"
Sis: "uu maghahanap talaga kme, pahinga lang ako 1 week?"
Rin: "maghanap ka na! sayang oras!"
Sis: "pagpahingahin mo naman ako noh!"
Rin: "pahinga!? e natulog ka lang naman!"

(and then she broke down and cried...)

Sis: " wag mo naman ako i-pressure oh, sobrang disappointed na nga rin ako sa sarili ko eh..."
Rin: "pressure? e kung magpalit kaya tayo ng pressure? .... *blah blah blah... kaboom!!!*"

And so, my day was ruined.

I then just left the house with the line: "umayos ka, alagaan mo nanay mo jan!"

It took me a great deal of effort too! its not just HER exerting all the hard work and sacrifices.. I had my fair share of pressure myself. And it frustrates me the most that all she could think about is her hardships. I may be jumping into conclusions but thats just how I feel right now.

Hopefully, somebody could prove me wrong. I don't care if she failed, she can take another exam on December for all I care. I just don't like the impression of being the bad guy here. I AM disappointed! but I do not pressure people...

.... am I?
