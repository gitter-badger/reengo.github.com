Lately we've been having issues with the band... but I guess its better to have these kind of problems early on, atleast we could have a more solid foundation when it gets resolved, that is IF it gets resolved!

Neutral Battles 

Our 3rd battle last nov 25 was the worst. compared to nov 4's battle at San Antonio, to which we almost won the champioship (almost! eheh). we just got the proof of how unorganized we are in terms of performance. wowowili has his own world when he sings. yes, he's good, but pakkit, he doesn't give a damn about the music. all he cares about is his own performance. slash and jnaut on the other hand competes on volume control, jnaut is moody on stage, chow hits that damn snare too hard and I screw up the bassline worrying too much about my bandmates and getting overconcious (if there's such a word). in short... we sucked! it happened on the 2nd song where it was supposed to be a perfected original compo. and yet, we've messed it up!

One fact that my bandmates dont get is that we cannot blame one for making mistakes. they shouldn't even blame themselves because if one of us suck, we all suck. but on the other hand, its okay to suck once in a while! just make sure that you dont suck all the time. because it friggin sucks! ehehe. (korni)

Neutral history

Before our first, real, clean and decent bar gig at Bandalismo Star on Mag:net cafe last June, we were cool. slash, Chow, Me, Ikel and Ezer was almost perfect. until 2 weeks before the gig,
Ezer was nowhere to be found. Ikel too was out, he joined this friggin networking syet and quit the band! Chow however, took 2 guys in for replacement, his gradeschool friends Wowowili (vox) and Jnaut (rythm). we got past Bandalismo Star and had a great time. more gigs followed... we even joined battles to gain more experience until lately, we couldn't handle the replacements well. they have their own other bands and loses focus on our band often. PASAWAY!

Neutral Shuffle

Now, Ezer came back to the picture... he said he wanted back! so the three of us talked about it. we really liked Ezer and we are in the process of getting pissed about the other 2, so we decided to get rid of them (but in a more diplomatic way of course ehehe) and take Ezer back in as lead vox but before we actually ask wowowili and jnaut out, we had news that ezer joined this other band whos quite famous. drats! so now, asking the other 2 for quits is hanging in the air. we have no choice but to give them another chance. after all, we already made some compos together. but right now, we are trying to pursue, a 3 piece band. maybe if we could be good with just us three, the original bunch, we could finally be stablized. we are also considering kittie to sing for us, since she can do metal but that would greatly affect our music... still, Kittie is a good bet. but I have other plans for her... ehehe. kittie and I are conceptualizing on a real Ska band so maybe she could just session for us at the moment.

We'll decide on saturday. if our trio wont work, we'll try Kittie. if it still wont work, we're Doomed!
