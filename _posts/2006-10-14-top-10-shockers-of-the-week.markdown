*Update: renamed such harsh wordings. sorry for those who've just read and got pissed about this post. bwehehe. I still think you're nuts though, ehehe. "
Right now, I'm at Moonwalker's PC, typing some nonesense while we take turns on his new bench press. (the dude is turning his room into a private gym! cool eh. ehehe.) then I figured, there were lots of things that bothered me this week... to elaborate, here's my top 10 shocking discoveries of the week.

1. I found the Icebreaker's page, got into her blogs and... well, did a few "tsk tsks" and laughed my guts out! crap... I think she's nuts! ehehe. I couldn't help but think about how Erusi is taking this... maybe this was the reason why im reading a lot of wierd posts from her page.

2. Lonely site is no more! that little site got deleted for some unknown reason... maybe the owner was harrassed by the icebreaker? ... clueless... am I? the hell do I care!? the owner has all the right to do whatever she wants with her page... but deleting it...!? oh well...

3. My female officemate has the hots for a colleague!? ehehe. its funny how most girls I know confide to me their little secrets... ehehe... makes me feel special... but ofcourse, the secret stays between us.

4. For a week now, Kittie haven't sent a single text message and doesn't even reply to any of mine... this is wierd, Im still backtracking of what conversation we might have had to make her act like this... or maybe this is paranoia kicking in again.

5. I could actually hide google ads from this multiply site to make my page look like a paid page! ehehe. css rocks.

6. RAK can actually support lots of site templates that I can apply from the framework I am currently working on. thank god the cms was opensource! ehehe.

7. Erusi Neechan still couldn't see the RIDE, even if I've already sent the exact url... well how can she? she deleted Lonely!

8. I can still friggin draw! ehehe. I thought all these web development and multimedia had me lost my drawing skills, but I tried drawing all my close friends, bandmates and officemates in chibi and I love it! ehehe. I'll post when colored.

9. I think I still need to learn not to stick my nose into other people's businesses. I've recently discovered how nosy I really am. Why do I need to dig in to Icebreaker's page? and since when did I became a friggin stalker? ha! Shame on me! crap... am I under a spell or something?

10. I couldnt come to Komikon 2006! darnit. we have a site launching soon and we need to work on it on overtime everyday starting next week. this includes saturdays... oh well, I could still try...

this week sucks... my head hurts...
