Have you ever gotten late at work or at school? but haven't got the guts to say the exact reason why you had always been late? Pepper and I recently compiled some of the weirdest excuses we've heard. Truthful or not... you decide.

**10. "Got stuck in traffic." **

- Classic. but off course you have to have a little creativity to have it work.

**9. "Got stuck in traffic. 2 buses collided and 1 got stuck in the middle of the highway. I changed route so came in late." **

- Yeah right. lets see that on the evening news.

**8. "I don't feel so good... I thought about calling in sick but decided to go to work anyways."**

- Yeah, if you're really sick. then you CAN'T go to work!

**7. "There has been a family emergency, My {relative} got hospitalized."**

- Of course it can't be you whose hospitalized, since you will be required to submit a 'med cert.' Unless they would require that of your so-called { relative }

**6. "A friend almost had a suicidal attempt due to a recent heartbreak. I helped cool him/her down."**

- now this is fairly original... and also lame. why can't any of your common friends do it? you are on your way to work/school anyways.

**5. "My pet died, burial took me a while since I had to do it secretly...."**

- With this, you would have to be known as an avid animal lover.

**4. "I broke up with by Girlfriend/Boyfriend on my way to work/school."**

- You can even use this repeatedly. unless you don't want to be the talk of the town.

**3. "I got stressed out and felt like work/school is no fun anymore. I was thinking of quitting."**

- This would always be effective, but can only be used once.. you might also be given consideration the entire day since you are depressed and all.

**2. "I had a suicide attempt earlier this morning. My life seemed to be worthless all of a sudden..."**

- This could sound like a lame joke but with good acting skills, this could be a winner.

**1. "I just found out that I could be dying.." **

( a month after... )

**"Oh, thank God! the record was not mine!"**

- This could get you excused with a convincing act. If they are looking for records, you can tell them that you were too depressed to even look at it since you will die anyway... And of course, always remember to knock on wood when you say so.

The best way to be excused is not to make an excuse at all. Simply come on time and plan ahead. If it would be impossible NOT to be late, just tell them you got Diarrhea.. works every single time!
