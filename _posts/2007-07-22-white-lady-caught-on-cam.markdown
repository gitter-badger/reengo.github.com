Our new house was an old church where some funerals were held. anyways, our neighbors were saying stuff about white ladies moving about at night on the neighborhood. They told us they were harmless but... oh well...








**The Picture:**
My (pacute) sister then took a picture of herself behind the window and guess what we saw? look at the picture carefully and look at whose behind the window... the picture is quite dark so you might need a little adjustments on the lighting. a reflection of a woman wearing a white dress with a weird face and long hair was smiling (or maybe angry...) at the background. Maybe she's reacting to the way my sister takes pictures of herself alone. eheh. She also seemed to be wanting a bit of exposure herself. bwehehe.

**Another mystery:
**I really don't know if you'd believe me. But this picture was deleted on my cellhone many months ago... we really didn't expect that the picture would come back... so... we didn't ever tried deleting it again. eheh.

Personally, I am not a believer of white ladies since I haven't seen one personally. And so, maybe this picture was just another odd reflection given a big fuzz. Anyways, you guys do the thinking...

**A Final Note:
**Scary isn't it? ... my sister I mean... BWEHEHE... The reason why she wanted to delete this is because of her not the image behind her... ehehe. JOKE! ... still.... its a mystery that needs no solving.
