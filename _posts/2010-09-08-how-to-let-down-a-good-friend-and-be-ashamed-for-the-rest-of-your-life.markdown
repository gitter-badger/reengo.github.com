Another good friend got married last September 4, 2010. The venue was Max's restaurant Ermita, Manila. Too many good things happened on this wedding... which sadly, I missed due to certain circumstances that can't be helped. Too ashamed to mention, I'll just leave the good things on focus.

The story of these two love birds has finally been sealed. I bare witnessed the hardships of these two for more than 5 years of long distance relationship enduring the loneliness of being far away from your beloved.

Best wishes to these wonderful couple. May you have a lot of mini Ronnels and Mini Dianes to come. (Basta sakin yung batik... jok.) God Bless panyero Onisama and his Momi and Happy Honeymooning.
