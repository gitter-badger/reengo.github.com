Everytime there's news about this game... my inner fan screams out loud. I mean if you haven't followed the game's development for the past decade... you're missing out on something.

Just today, on an interview with director Hajime Tabata... He mentioned something that made one reassurance... We wont be waiting for more than a year at least :D.

> "We can certainly say to people: it's not going to be 2017. It's going to be before that." - Hajime Tabata

... atleast.

In the meantime, here's the awesome FFXV: DAWN TRAILER. \*\*heavy breathing...\*\*
