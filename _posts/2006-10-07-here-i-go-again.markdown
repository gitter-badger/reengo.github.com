Wow, its been a year since I last meddled with this page! ehehe. Suddenly, nostalgia came over me. I think I have been missing the blog thing a lot.

The past year had been an adventurous one for me. I've tried out different things, met a lot of new friends, had a better job, entered a different world and lived a different lifestyle. I have successfully kept myself busy for the past year and so far, I still haven't seen the results I was expecting.

Wierd... it seems like only a few minutes has passed since the incident... but anyways, enough crap lets get into the news.

So what's up for today?

Later tonight, Neutral Caliber will be performing live alongside talented indie bands in QC at Wilfredos Bar... makes me feel so excited! ehehe. problem is, I still got no bass to use! hopefully, Ry could get a hold of the Fender Squire again.

Our new compo will be having its debut for the public ear tonight. Its entitled "Grasaman" (taong grasa) ehehe. If you wnat to hear the song, drop by at Wilfredos Bar, Fairview QC. near SM Fairview. tickets are at 100 Php with free booze.

That is all for today, Ill fill you in on the details soon but for now, I need to get back to work. ehehe.
