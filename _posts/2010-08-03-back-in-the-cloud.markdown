Finally! after almost a couple of months of no-DSL at home, Im back in the cloud WITH NO INTERRUPTIONS!

Cursing PLDT for their GODFORSAKEN CUSTOMER SUPPORT would have to wait for now. Gotta save my energy in case the service fails again. ehehe.

Sis indeed saved the day again... thanks to her, I'm getting back on track.

no more Smart Broken, no more computer shops, no more free wifi on malls... simply... more work. eheh
