5 months... 5 FRIGGIN months of no Salary! YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!! For loyalty? NAH! for career growth? NAH! wait a minute? where's the growth in there!?

I grew tired of asking office mates about news on the salary.. when would it be finally coming out...? would there still be a "company"? questions here and there comes back and forth, over and under our noses but still... no dough. Indeed those bastards were heartless. (No need to put detail on this.)

I got mouths to feed. Jenny took it strongly, shouldering most of household expenses. She barely has enough for herself to be happy with her life... and I just cant live with that! I am used to being a breadwinner and it sucks to see my sister take the burden.

So, I eventually decided to strengthen my focus on freelance work. I've contacted former clients and told them that I would be accepting work for full time--one responded. Eventually I decided opening up a Freelancer.com account since its growing quite famous on freelance designers and developers in the Philippines and to my surprise, my first bid actually won! That first project was a simple Flash related project that I got to finish in less than 2 hours. The client was happy and wanted to work with me again some other time, one lucky start indeed! however, a couple of more bids following that lucky first were lost. Until I got this new client from US who's A jumpy supermeticulous SEO expert who was outsourcing design work focused on SEO.

_**"Search engine optimization** (**SEO**) is the process of improving the visibility of a web site or a web page in search engines via the "natural" or un-paid ("organic" or "algorithmic") search results." - wikipedia.com

He was a great client, though sometimes his instructions were too vague, he was happy that I always understood what needs to be done without repeating instructions all the time... this buyer's pay was good but eventually, I know I needed to slow down a bit since he's always too hasty and like I said... jumpy! I know that one day, when I finally get a new job. this jumpy good paying client could really be demanding more time sooner or later.

These Freelancer.com clients and some other clients I have with Elance.com and former clients who responded to my stress call, were all life savers. at least it kept my sanity in tact on that 5 MADAPAKKING months of "NO-PAY". Ironically, Its the "New way NOT to Pay" (Sarcastically mimicking the company tagline). Since early this year, I've been doing various outsourced projects home-based (if only my employer has a heart... and not to mention professional decency.), and most of my experiences are as follows:

**PSD to XHTML/CSS**

These were good projects for me since I always enjoy doing design work. pay was good but without any scope agreement of some sort with the client, this type of project could get you working until your client is satisfied and you are burned out. KEEP YOUR FOCUS ON THE SCOPE OF WORK!

**Wordpress/Joomlah/Drupal Modifications**

This could be easy as a PHP coder for at least a year but it could be a lot easier if you got this working with plugins, components and modules in mind. I've experienced working on these using direct php modifications to implement requested changes, but I think it would be better to study modularizing these changes into plugins (for wordpress) or components (for joomla). you would be surprised when a similar task from a different client arrive and you only get to reuse your genuinely built module for an easy income! bwehehe.

**REWRITE Jobs**

Still SEO related. I think if you have skills in coding, design and others related to web development you might as well skip this option. I have experienced writing rewrite projects for at least 10-15 articles a week (I only lasted 1 week. ehehe) and compared to my coding income... it was shit.

The Deal:

1. You are given articles to rewrite. sometimes they would require you to write a fresh review of a given product.
2. You rewrite the given article without any trace of plagiarism, 450+words per article, with at least 5+ instances of the keyword on the title, first sentence, first paragraph, and all over the article itself.
3. You check your work on plagiarism tester apps such as "DupeFree Pro" or Copyscape and ensure that you have at least 20% duplication rate at most. (21% and above are unacceptable)
4. You submit your work to client
5. You wait 5 days or more for feedback. if you dont. you get your pay on the agreed day mostly on Paypal
6. And lastly, You get paid a dollar upto 3 dollars an article... WHAT!? nuff said.





ReCaptcha Projects

You betcha, I also did some of these type of projects for experience purposes. Google recaptcha for more info.

The Deal:

1. You will be given a recatpcha account by the client. (This is where you login and keep track of your recaptchas)

2. On prompt. a "ReCaptcha" image will be shown to you for answering. (If you still haven't googled this one yet, its a process where 2 captcha images are displayed for you to answer, but unlike regular captchas, google makes use of these to effectively translate books for digitization to which the OCR scanners failed to correctly recognize).

3. you answer these 2 words displayed. and see prompt if your answer is correct or not.

4. after a correct (or incorrect) answer. another pair of recaptcha is shown. This will go on until your hearts content.
5. for the pay.... a whopping $1 for every 1000 recaptchas! thats 1000 pairs of captchas!

**PHP Developement**

This is where it gets interesting. Here you get to have the freedom you want (on most cases) if you're a good negotiator. Most buyers really do not know how to estimate pure PHP coding in terms of work hours. Client would normally believe and trust your estimates since it is actually the exact reason why they need your help. your expertise. but of course, If you are planning to use this against them... better be prepared for the consequences this would entail your professional career.

**Flash Work**

Ah my first love. Since the start of my career in IT, I've always been fascinated with Flash and AS. Yes, I know the drawbacks and most other negative things about flash... but hey at least 90% of all browsers have flash in it. And 30-40% of all existing web pages in the word has it. But anyways... be mindful of cross-browser compatibility when doing Flash projects.

**SEO Website Revamp**

Revamping an existing website for SEO also pays well as freelance. This could be tiring on non-framework based websites, procedural coded sites and static webpages that you would be required to edit one page at a time. Checking all instances of the <img> tag and making sure they all have alt="" and title="" attributes as well as coding metadata manually from keywords to description could really be.... well.... BORING.



Bottom line is, I really got to make a living out of freelancing when times were indeed tough. But freelancing can be tough too when mismanaged. Building good client relationship is the key, be professional and deliver results in the exact agreed scope. no more, no less. unless they pay extra of course. eheh. Who knows, maybe this business could mean your success.
