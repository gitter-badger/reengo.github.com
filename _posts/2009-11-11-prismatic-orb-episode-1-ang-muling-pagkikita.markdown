It has been 2 years since Luc and Van last met and what a reunion it had been for the two of them! Luc hardly recognized Van as she had transformed herself from a chubby firl into an amazingly slima nd dassling your lady that really took the attention of most guys on campus yet, the perky gestures and the cheerfulness still remains. 

In the meantime, Clio had an urgent message from the mysterious oracle that haunts her dreams. Something is about to happen that will change the way they live forever. 

As for Gareth, being a stubborn jerk paid off badly as another mysterious girl gave him a doze of his own medicine. Un aware of the world driving closely in peril, three of the chosen ones went off with their normal lives. And the enemy underlying the shadows will soon emerge to break the silence.
