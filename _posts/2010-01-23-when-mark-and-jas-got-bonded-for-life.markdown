It was really a very inspiring experience and I wish I had the money ... err... the readiness to tie the knot as splendid as this one.

Mark and Jas had a well executed wedding. I can safely say that it was almost perfect (since nothing is really perfect ehehe), and it was all worth it. We had a fun time with old friends especially while eating good food. Though I really didn't like the bland taste of the catering service's Carbonara. But the lechon de leche was swabe, it got me dizzy but it was swabe. Also, the desert section kicked ass, I was able to make my own Banana Split ala Jologs.

Overall the wedding was great, but there were 2 names that got my attention:

**Threelogy Video**

I was really amazed at how quick they were able to edit an HD wedding video in a span of like, an hour or so? (basing on the footage taken on the exact same day.) When  I got home I took a quick glance at the site and got surprised to see a whopping  Php120,000 rate on a 25 minute HD video coverage with 3 high end Sony HD camcorders! It was quite expensive but judging from the quality of their output... it was worth it and damn! they are good! [check them out, click this link](http://threelogyvideo.com)

I have an HD camcorder myself, a Sony HDR-CX100 and I was amazed on how good their video turned out. So now, I have some new items listed on my to-do list:

1. Study how they manage to edit huge HD videos so freaking easy! When I try it on my Clio2(my 2.66 core 2 duo PC with 4gb memory and 256mb videocard), it was a bit slow to process previews and sometimes playback was very chappy. I was able to fix it issues using Pinnacle Studio 11 but still, I doubt that I could edit THAT fast...

2. Research on how I can maximize my HD cam to full potential.

3. Do some market research on how profitable video coverage/editing services are. Damn! these guys are so good, I want to try to do what they do... which basically is the reason why I bought my camcorder.

**Pose N' Print**

I find their business innovative, like most Videoke's nowadays that are available for rent, these guys turned their improvised high end digital photo booth  (not to mention with 2 high quality printers for faster photo printing) into something really interesting. Whats good is that, the well assisted service is good for unlimited photo prints for all guests! with online upload of photos taken. Mark and Jas probably took the [4 hour photo booth service priced at Php 14,500](http://www.poseandprint.com/picture?name=20100123_Mark_Jasmin&currpage=2&size=grid&picture=IMG_2756-logo&gridname=IMG_2756-logo), which, in my opinion, is another well invested alternative for wedding souvenirs.

So far, this is one of the best weddings I've attended to. Thank you so much Mark and Jas for inviting me, though sadly Richmon wasn't able to attend, but it was a blast nonetheless. Best wishes to you both and happy honeymooning. eheh. _Humayo kayo at magparami!_
