Last night... it wasn't full moon... but a werewolf appeared at the orange house. tsktsk. she huff and puff and nearly blew the house down... ehehe.

Since my resignation from my previous work, people had been resigning 1 after the other. the "domino effect" indeed. These things happen for a reason... each person that has resigned have different reasons. To cut the story short, the company is suffering from consecutive employee resignations... and they are looking for a fall guy... Blaming people for their own mistakes... and they now blame me! tsktsk.

After Batgirl told me the news I recieve a pm from the admin assistant... (Capitana...) saying these lines...


Capitana: hi Rin, alam mo n cguro na naforced resignation si Batgirl, nabring-up ka daw at parang alam na ni Motohime Sakura yung idadahilan, kung may gusto kang sabihin kay Motohime Sakura, you can call her sa 0922853****.
Rin: kaw ba nag type nyan?
Rin: tsktsk...
Capitana: uu
Rin: naiinis ako...
Rin: pero hindi ako tatawag kay motohime sakura
Rin: email ko sya
Rin: unfair ginawa nya
Capitana: ikaw bahala
Rin: to think na ginagawa ko lahat para iconvince si batgirl na wag magresign!
Rin: tsktsk
Capitana: i think kelangan mo nga sya kausapin to confirm kung ano b talaga ang ngayari, wag kang maniniwala sa cnabi ng isang side lamang, linawin mo muna ang both parties, k?
Rin: kaya nga e... logoff muna ako
Rin: online ba sya?
Capitana: cno?
Rin: motohime sakura?
Capitana: uu pero medyo busy, sabi nya pwede mo daw sya tawagan ngayon
Capitana: gusto mo ba sa landline?
Capitana: o kaya ako n lng tawag sau, naka off ata cell mo?
Capitana: oi! san kana?
Capitana: pwede mo sya tawagan sa 856-**** kc andun sya sa conference room, may line doon.


I couldn't get myself to reply anymore...

It got to my nerves when I knew I was suspected of destabilization (anu to? philippine government?). When all I ever did was to help the company improve! their people know what I do for their company even though I am not part of it anymore... I do it because the people there were not just my ex-officemates... but my dear friends.... Batgirl tried to defend me and yet, she was fired... NO! she was forced to resign! PAKSYIT! is there such a word? yeah right! just the right excuse for a CHEAP DISMISSAL! (The management is used NOT to give their people the things that they deserve...) mark these words: SEPARATION PAY IS BETTER THAN NO BACKPAY!!!!

Here was my "nerve letter":





Hi Motohime Sakura,




This is Rin, I'm sorry I cannot call you tonight. You know that I am not good with words, and I speak my mind better written. I have to be frank, I really dont like the fact that you are involving me on Batgirl's resignation. In fact I am so enraged that calling you now won't be a good Idea as you are suggesting. It is so unfair that you are forcing her to resign because of me... I want to know your side of the story. but please hear mine first...




I always talk to Batgirl via ym. yes, we converse, just like any other friends that she had on her list. and just like most of your employees do... eversince.... but our conversations were just "chats" If disturbance of work is the reason for her forced resignation, here is my explanation:




As friends do, Batgirl asked me for an advice, she wanted to resign because she said she wasn't happy with your company anymore... I talked to her... I told her to stay... or at least finish the 6 months probationary period you have given her. I HAVE CONVINCED HER TO STAY. And that was all there is to it! If you think I am the reason why people resign from your company, please.. THINK AGAIN!. 




ALL of your employees are my friends. I talk to them, just as I would when I was at your office. If this is such a bad thing for you. I will refrain from sending them personal messages. but they are STILL my friends and If they send me something, I WILL REPLY. 




Please do send me your side of the story for me to sleep well. I dont like being blamed for the things i did not do....




Rin





PAKSYIT!

They were calling my cp... when I told them not to! ... it was at them that I learned... at these kinds of situations... you need proofs! telephone conversations are not documented unless you record it... EMAIL IS BETTER since I have valid documentation... poeple working for them had been self thought to be clever... they now have a doze of their own medicine... but guess what!? THEY DIDN'T REPLY!

again.... PAKSYIT!
