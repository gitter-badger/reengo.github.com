People say I complicate things too much. Well, isn't the world complicated? you look for something and do whatever it takes to find it. And when you get it, its still not enough. nothing is ever enough. syit.

One of the reasons why I left my previous job was the lack of authority. I was looking for respect and appreciation for my hardwork. Though I was admitedly not perfect to fit their standards of a qualified manager (as they put it), I worked my ass off overtime because I knew I was needed. I never had that authority, since I was handling myself as my own team, and my team sucks, eheh. I felt like a loner, and my officemates were my cheering squad backing me up.

Now, I have my own REAL team. They look up to me with respect and appreciate what I do (even if I am overdoing it). eheh. I'm really am thankful to have such opportunity to have great people appreciate what I do. My current team is the best I had (since it was the first. eheh.) I only have 1 teammate that I find hard to manage... myself. eheh. But still, a lot of work needs to be done with people management.

Its never an easy task handling people. A truck load of patience is not enough. You need to act, set an example, be THE MAN and say the right words at the right time, ALL THE TIME. Its like acting as a parent ordering chores to a rebelious teenage son or daughter, if you piss them off, they leave home. It is what I find the hardest to deal with, handling emotions, not only yours but the whole team's (especially when you're friends with THE Team). You have shortcomings, but your team will find it hard to realize that. They have moodswings too. When stressed, they blame you. When they become bored and don't have much to do, they blame you. when the boss gets disappointed with the whole team, THEY ALL BLAME YOU. Its a burden actually, the responsiblity to get the job done with stress and your team's rants behind your back.

Some people needs to understand that at the office, you have to set friendship aside and work professionally.

1. When your manager asks you something, you don't answer like, "tinatamad ako e, bukas nalang!" Have you ever consider saying that to your boss? and technically, they are indeed, your boss!

2. You do not choose managers, managers choose you. You can't say that you need a better manager because your manager lacks this and that... If you have problems with your manager, tell it to the hr, write a letter or something. they will be the ones to decide, but in the meantime.. DO YOUR JOB!.

3. You don't decide on your own. You shouldn't say, "I know this better than my manager does, Its for our own good, I'll act now without telling my manager because im out of time..." even if you think you know better, your manager deserves the right to comment.

4. You do not bypass! you shouldn't go out saying something like, "You're not techy enough to understand what I am saying, I will speak directly to my teammates and bypass you." your manager has all the right to know anything and everything that you do.

5. "EXPLAIN BEFORE YOU COMPLAIN" as my idol Joey de Leon puts it, your mistakes are best explained before squeeling about the shortcomings, impediments and limitations. you dont go saying, "how can I program well when I dont have a pc!?" ehehe. resourcefulness is part of your responsibility, If you cant work well because of something, do not whine, act on it. tell it to the authorities so they can act on it as well.

Dealing with myself is also a pain in the ass, punctuality has always been a problem with me. I'm lucky my company doesn't take it against me. Its the one thing that inspires me to work past my limitations and even my biological clock. eheh.

Becoming a manager is such hard work that sometimes demoralizes you. People should understand that we all have a lot on our hands but the managers are on the front line. They say or do things that sometimes jeopardizes friendship but it's only what you call PROFESSIONALISM. and that doesn't make them "PETS" of the company.
