**R. Mika**, that busty and bouncy japanese wrestler joins in on the fight and she brings a long a tag team partner, **Nadeshiko**

Honestly, I'm not that excited to see her back... she's annoying as hell! But better her than **El Fuerte!** :D

Nadeshiko also joins in for the assists. Could be a good variety since this would be the first time its gonna happen since Street Fighter Alpha.

Though not a playable character (I could be wrong sooner or later ). Nadeshiko looks fun to watch using R.Mika. This also makes their story arc interesting as well.
