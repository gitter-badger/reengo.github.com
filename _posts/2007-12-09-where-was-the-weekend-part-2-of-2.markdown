Chillin at Jill's Birthday Fartie! |  Saturday Approx.11:00pm
I arrived at Jill's place around 11:00pm and saw a bunch of new faces. However, the typical bunch were there...Vahn, Jigs, Ana, and ofcourse... Kittie. Izza was absent but I think I know why... bwehehe. and MayMay was at a company christmas party... Mai came soon after to join the fun, she had just came from an audition for band performers in Korea and well... the subject of debate for the band's issues was exactly THAT... and... The hell do I care with their issues! bwehehe. I'm just here to support. ehehe.

We ate a lot, drank some booze, and talk like theres no tomorrow. bwehehe. everyone was tired, Vahn was the first to sleep at Jill's room then Mai followed... then, I was showing Kittie some pics when all of a sudden, there was this picture of her way back last year that I took while she was sleeping, She saw it and said... "Akala ko binura mo na to..." honestly, I thought I have already did delete the picture but luckily though, she didn't went berserk and beaten me up with a stick! eheh. Kittie then followed Mai upstairs and started getting some sleep. Jill and I had stood up for until 8:00am without sleep while watching my DVD and some talking...Â  after that... Kittie was on my mind... shit. I knew meeting her again after so long wouldn't make much effect but it did. so now, I'm into a lot of confusion yet again. I slept around 8:30am when I arrived home. and PAKKIT! my head hurts.

IPS Band Practice | Sunday Approx. 11:00am
I then woke up a bit later and contacted the Band, eheh. Jumong has an urgent task (on a sunday) so we agreed over ym to reschedule our practice to 6pm. I then called ameng to confirm and then we were all set. I took a quick sleep and went to GMA Kamuning MRT Station to Meet up with Kimpee. Atemimi and Jumong arrived soonafter then we went to Blues on a cab.



I had to admit. we were slow paced on the learning curve since our guitarists had no experience performing on stage and at least... performing. but for a newly formed band... we did great. Kimpee was steady on guitars and Atemimi was able to take on the lead guitars. We also tried shuffling instruments, I worked the drums and jumong did the lead guitars. We would be scheduling practice again tomorrow at lunch break to clean up what we finished. The next time we practice though. we need the vocalists to be with us!

Sleepblogging | 3:00am
Err... I came home from band practice at 11:30 pm and had a quick sleep and so here I am somewhat Sleep Blogging (since i woke up I couldn't get myself to sleep again) to finish this 2 part blog of yet another hectic weekend.... if this goes on though... I might grow old fast. bwehehe. good thing though, is that I enjoy growing old like this....
