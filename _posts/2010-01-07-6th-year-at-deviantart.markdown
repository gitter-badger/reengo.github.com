[![Badong](http://www.reengo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Triangle_Trauma_Cover_Art_by_LASZIO-236x300.jpg)](http://www.reengo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Triangle_Trauma_Cover_Art_by_LASZIO.jpg)I took a visit at my old DeviantART account this morning and found out that it was supposed to be my 6th year today. January 7, 2010. sheesh! and my last loggin was almost 5 YEARS AGO! damn... 5 years....

I miss the old days of Deviant ART where you get to post your artworks and immediately someone from somewhere would hit you a comment. Could be a random guy seeing random posts of random people or someone having you on their watch list. It was in fact, very rewarding to see someone appreciate your work and even "fav"s it to display on their page. Some would also provide you constructive criticism and tell you flat out where you've gone wrong. It was really a very inspiring community, below is a copy of my stat (sadly I was inactive for 5 years).
