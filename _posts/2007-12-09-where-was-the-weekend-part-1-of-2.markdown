Oyash, T'was a really long weekend indeed. Tsktsk...but it was fun. only tiring though.

Friday Night Movie and TimeZoning! | Approx. 8:00pm
After work, I went out with friends and ate dinner at Shelby's. Me, Clars, DJ Tummy, Umbrella, Komiks, Navarro and Bubbles finished dinner fast since Inkong was waiting at Glorietta alone. eheh. We then arrived at Glorietta and Bubbles detatched from the group to catch up with mrt and went home. I felt a bit guilty having left the cd she requested me to burn ASIN songs with. I recommended her to Izza as Gijena's new keyboardist so she needed mp3's of asin to practice... oh well... (bawi next time.. eheh.)

We catched up with Inkong and quickly bought the tickets for the movie "The Golden Compass" we were minutes late but we had no choice but to watch it since we cant afford to wait for the next movie. We had fun watching the movie eeven if it really SUCKED! eheh. I simply like how they did the Polar Care Bears... they rule!. (and did I mention Komiks fell asleep watching the movie? ehehe.) After the movie, we did a bit of Timezoning and had fun (mejo bitin lang talaga... tsktsk).

_ I was showing something to DJ Tummy.... then she said, "Oh my.. that looks so yummy..."_

Chismisan with Icecreams | Saturday Approx. 12:30am
After the movie, We went back to Glorietta tand tried getting back to unfinished Timezoning businesses! bwehehe (adiik) but since we couldn't get back in, we tried looking for a coffee shop instead but somehow ended up at Icebergs... were looking for beer on the menu... but there weren't any... wierd... bwehehehehe. we talked stuff and then went home.

Conference with the Bajulas | Saturday Approx. 3:30am
I got home at around 3:00am and quickly went online to set up my torrents. bwehehe. Asura buzzed me. I told her I was about to sleep but we ended up into a conference chat that lasted 30 minutes. eheh. then... I fell asleep..

Sis and the Cramps! |Saturday Approx. 5:00am
My silent slumber was ruined wthen my sister sunddenly screams and everybody was in panic. she was having cramps that usually wakes up the entire neighborhood in the morning... tsktsk. I really need to have her check up soon.

Solo Practice |Saturday Approx. 10:00am
I then woke up far off the wrong side of the bed. A bit moody to talk with family issues and had everyone do their stuff and leave me alone. ehehe. I got online and checked on my mails and saw Atemimi's line up... alist of songs that we were to perform at the company christmas party... shit... it was so damn long... bwehehe. I then went practicing a bit and decided to contact them.

I then went to Jill's store and found both Vahn and Jill playing with their faces. bwehehe. They were wearing make up in a market for crying out loud! tsktsk. anyways I had a bit of a chat and went off to Roan's place.

Silverchair and the Calendar Module |Saturday Approx. 4:00pm
I then went to Silverchair's place and thought her how to make her own calendar module... She also invited me to go to Claren's place for her birthday party but I told her that I was coming at Jill's so can't come. I then hurried to makati and tried to look for a studio to practice at... tsktsk. I'm out of time...
  
Studio Hunting | Saturday Approx. 5:00pm
I arrived Glorietta (again) and met with the band. after eating hotdogs we asked around a studio and found nothing. Pipeline had been closed, Perfect pitch no longer has studios for rehearsals, Lazer too was out of studios. We ended up going as far as Kamuning to practice at the Greyhounds'  Blues Family Studio which we practice with Easter. we havent got a good sked so we descided to call it a day and try again the next day... sheesh.

To be Continued...
