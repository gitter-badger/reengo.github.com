CHAPTER 2:

It was a bright new day that followed. Shan was patiently guarded by her master Molt. He had slept  holding her hand, resting his head over it sleeping steadily next to her. Watching every breath, every heartbeat. And when she slowly opened her eyes as Shan wakes up,

“Urg, (gnaw)… SIR!?!” Shan wakes her silent guru.

“Shan! Thank goodness!” surprisingly Molt had spoken.

“You fainted last night, you should have seen your friends leave, They said they wanted to stay by your side, but I told them they should go on with their mission. And 
that I’ll just be the one to stay… by your side,” Molt said to the blushing Shan.

“Oh, sir, I…” 

“Shhh, haven’t I told you not to call me sir out of school grounds, you’re disobeying your teacher, Shan.” Molt said.

“Happy Birthday” he said with a smile as he slowly walks out of Shan’s room

“Wait! Where are you going?” Shan asked, holding to the sapphire pendant that Molt gave to her as a gift.

“I haven’t thank you yet!” Shan said with her eyes seemingly shy.

“Whatever I did for you to thank me is nothing compared to what you did for all of us last night.” 

“Shan, if it wasn’t for you, the city should have been burned to ashes. People should have died out there. I saw how you cared for others at the same time, I’ve seen your undeniable strong will and effort as you held the whole city tightly secured! You see, this is why you should go outside Angelica where learning is affluent. People who finished their studies here leave as magic knights and aims to protect Angelica and other countries as well. But you, I think you can bring the whole of Macenova and hold it tightly secured. So as to never disrupt again!”

Molt was really serious about the things he was saying and Shan seem to have seen this side of her master for the very first time.

“Last night wasn’t coincidental. I think it has something to do with me, I feel like I should be blamed for all that happen!” Shan cried, scared, and Molt was pitiful so he embraced Shan and said,

“Last nights phenomena doesn’t mean anything, rather than blaming yourself, you should be proud! You have been a heroine! Every one in the city hails you.” Molt said, and Shan grins.

“There! Look at yourself you’re smiling! You should always be! “ 

Molt leaves the heroines house with both relief and fear…

He knew that the incident last night really do mean something, falling rains of fire is a sign of upcoming massive destruction. In the legends, Cet the annihilator said before being imprisoned inside Macenova, “You may immure my soul, but you cannot imprison my will, my wrath will paint the sky with blood before covering the land in shadow! I, will be the one to pick the flower as she blooms and you’ll all feel her deadly thorns before I shower you with chaos.” These words repeatedly ran across Molt’s mind: what if Shan’s birthday really is related to the fire rain, Cet talked about painting the sky with blood as if  burning it. And the rain timingly stroke the land precisely simultaneous to Shan’s birthday! Molt might not say it but he has a very complicated theory.  For him, Shan simply might be what Cet was calling “flower.”

Shan then dressed up and prepared. She’s now ready to leave for her test. She thought that somehow, Molt’s test could give a clue to what mystery she currently faces.

She then went to her faithful horse Shell but she was slightly dejected when she saw no signs of her beloved horse, She suspected that Shell went off to the forest so she didn’t had time to think twice and went there. On her way, people keep greeting her with thanks, treating her like a hero deserving of such praises.

Finally she reached the forest near Ghislan and found Shell munching on some grass. So she called her. Mysteriously, Shell became wild and ran away from Shan as if she was afraid of her. Shan attempted to follow but Shell was just fast that she quit. Shan thought that Shell was just playing around. What she didn’t know was that somehow, Shell suddenly became afraid of her. So she went back to Ghislan and looked for her friend Doma and asked for a ride to Angelica. Doma delivers milk to Angelica so he rode with her. They were chatting lively about the incident the other night when suddenly the cart bumped onto a rock on the road and moments later, the cart’s left wheel collapsed and the milk spilled out as the cart tilted to the side. Doma and Shan fell out but Doma broke his ankle. Shan helped him out but unfortunately she can’t do anything to help Doma’s cart and his hurting ankle.

“Don’t worry ‘bout me, I’m okay” Doma said

“You should go on right ahead, my horse should probably bring me back to the city. But my milk…aw nevermind!” he followed.

“I’m sorry for your misfortune. But thanks anyway, I’ll just probably walk through Angelica. After all, we’re just halfway there. Are you sure you’re okay? Want me to bring you back to the city first”

And so she walked right through the road on foot carrying only the scroll and her pendant clipped on her collar.

“Well, isn’t this great, my horse is fooling around and I have to walk all the way to Angelica!” she said, as she walks straight to the castle where she departs. 

And as she enters the castle, Molt was there,

“Hey Shan! What a surprise! I was about to pick you up, you’re late!. The first batch of people going to Allona had just left. You should probably go check the teleporter if it can still send a passenger, want me to walk you there?” Molt said.

“Don’t worry, I’ll be okay just tell me were the teleporter is.” Shan replied.

“Well I guess I’ll just have to take you there myself. After all, guards won’t let you in without an official so, come on!” Molt held Shan’s right hand and went inside the castle. Then, while passing through the gate, Shan had wondered. Why would the guards lower their heads in Molt’s presence. As if he was a Prince, 

“ a Prince?” she said to herself. “Nah!”
          
Molt showed the teleporter to Shan and saw pitches of smoke coming out of its engine-like apparatus proving that it has just been used. So Molt asked the attendant,

“Hey, is this thing gonna work for one more passenger?” he said.

“Well, I guess it still can, after all, one passenger takes up only a small amount of energy.”
         
And so Shan bid farewell to Molt and said,

“Don’t worry, I’ll finish this test as fast as I can, so I can give you the result and graduate. Then, we’ll be of the same rank and I’ll never call you sir again!” Shan laughed as she walked inside the module.

“You take care of yourself there Shan, remember you must never open the scroll until you reach King Juliam’s presence. Always be aware of your surroundings and check your equipment constantly!” Molt said with obvious worry.

“Okay, okay, I’m going to be out for just a while!” 

And so she left, the teleporter worked and send her to Allona… but something went wrong, she felt somehow lost. And lost she were,

She fell in a marketplace, to the roof of a small store to what she wrecked. The little store crashed down as if it was dropped by an elephant. And of course, the storekeeper became mad. Covered with his piles of his merchandise, the store keeper shouted,

“Hey! Who the hell destroyed my store?” Shan was stuck with her face still covered as the storekeeper continues to shout at her face.

“Come on you stupid numbskull, show your ugly little…” on a brief moment Shan uncovers her face. 

“…f, face.” The storekeeper stopped as Shan struggles to stand up.

“(ooh, hmp) hey! Who do you think you are, shouting  at me like that!” Shan said furiously.

“Oh, umm, hi! My name is Leigh, I’m a swordsmith, and a humble salesman whose store had currently been demolished, thanks to you” the man said calmly yet angry.

“So you’re a black smith, a mean old black smith,” she said. stomping out of the wreck that entangles her.

“Oh, I’m sorry that I shouted! I just thought you were one of those ‘city crashers’, they just continue to annoy me.” Leigh said.

“It’s okay, you know it’s weird that the teleporter send me outside, I should have been sent inside Allona!” Shan said.

“What are you talking about?” Leigh said while fixing his store in shambles. 

“and what is this teleporter thing your talking about?” he continued.

“Look, I’m sorry about crashing into your store, but I have a very important audience to prepare for the king.” Shan said as she was helping Leigh fix the store.

“Wait! I’ve heard you said Allona! Are you planning on going there?” Leigh asked as they had set the crashed store aside.

“This conversation won’t speed up my mission so, (ahem) it’s been nice meeting you, Leigh, but I must be going.” Shan said hurriedly.

“Hey! wait, stop! I haven’t got your name yet,” Leigh shouted . and as Shan leaves, she left a sweet smile and said,

“It’s Shan!”

”Shan… Shan… Shan…!” Leigh  continued to speak Shan’s name over and over
as if he was mesmerized by her simple beauty!

Meanwhile, Shan continues to walk around the city over and over until she realized,

“Hey! Where the hell is that castle. I thought this is a huge city.” Shan scratched her head and went back to Leigh’s store. Luckily, she still catches the sword smith packing his merchandise seemingly leaving.

“Hi! Excuse me, Leigh?” Shan said.

“Umm… Shan! What brought you back here?” 

“I’ve been walking around the city, and was kinda wondering.  how come,  all the while that I’d seek for the castle, I still can’t find it. Do you know any road leading to the castle?” Shan asked.

“Wha… what castle?” Leigh answered. 

“I thought you were going to Allona?” he followed.

“Yes, I was, and I know that I’m close to it somehow, after all, the teleporter is destined to go there” she said.

“Hehe, hehehe”  

“Hey, what’s so funny?” Shan said.

“Heh, you’ve walked around the city and you still don’t know?” Leigh continues to laugh.

“Know what?” Shan asked. 

“That your lost!”

“whaaaaat! Are you kidding, the teleporter just cant fail you know, you
