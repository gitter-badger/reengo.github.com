[A Call for Change Flash Movie](http://reenworx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/bscs1.swf)
(pakkit! I can't embed a flash movie on this friggin' post!)

I was cleaning up my files when I noticed this flash movie on my flash projects folder... shit, I miss my college days. I've only spent 1 semester in college but it had been a blast.The flash video above is played at the background, operated by Michelle Ostan, and Narrated by "Babaylan". Up front is where me, Slash and Gameng play the guitar singing "Banal na Aso" by Yano tweaking the lyrics up a bit. It's a call for change approach with a little twist. An optional performance that I suggested our prof to give a chance for low graders to pass the subject. I was credited by the prof since I no longer need an adjustment but the effort led the entire group to pass the subject... I had been a hero... (at least I think I did) ...and it felt good.
