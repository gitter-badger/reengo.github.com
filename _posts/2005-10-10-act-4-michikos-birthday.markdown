Chapter 2: Chasing Rainbows  
  
At recess time…  
  
“Say Michiko, what would be the menu this year huh?” Misato asked.  
“What menu?”  
“Hey don’t fool around, its your Birthday tomorrow silly!”  
“Um… oh that! … hehe… heh…” Michiko was a bit embarrassed. Michiko’s mom habitually treats the whole class every year on Michiko’s birthday at recess time and mostly, the menu writes donuts. But of course, it might be different this year… Misato hoped so. Teachers had always been considerate about these kinds of occasions and sometimes they would adjust class hours for the students to enjoy the treats at recess time. The teachers would sometimes reorganize the seats as they would when there are certain occasions like the feast day or foundation day. Seats were lined up at the corners to give a wide space at the center to act like a stage of some sort. Students were seated 2 rows at all four sides of the classroom and the room would instantly look like a party room.  
  
“Yeepee! It’s your birthday tomorrow Michiko! Whoohoo… can’t wait for the donuts!” Ritsuki mentioned overhearing the two.  
“Um… I’m not really sure if mom’s gonna come visit tomorrow… she’s quite busy lately”  
“Of course she is, and even if she would actually come, she won’t tell you cause it’s a surprise right? Ahehe, were in for some treats tomorrow, this is exciting.”  
“Oh c’mon Ritsuki, those are just donuts! Hehe.”  
“Anything free is worth the excitement Michiko. Ahehe. advance happy birthday to ya.”  
“hehe, thanks Ritsuki.”  
  
“Hey, do I hear a birthday party coming up?” Banjo enters the scene with Jin and Eiji coming from the canteen.  
“Its Michiko’s birthday you dummy.” Jin added.  
“Really? So what? What’s so special about Michiko’s birthday?”  
“how mean…” Eiji exclaimed.  
“I was just kidding!”  
“Don’t eat when Michiko’s mom pay a visit tomorrow. The likes of you do not deserve those goodies.” Misato added.  
“Hey! I WAS kidding! mmm… goodies eh?” Banjo replied.  
“Just be absent tomorrow Banjo! Everything will be just great without you!”  
“Argh! Now THAT is mean. You old hag!”  
“Don’t push it 4 eyes!”  
“Oh yeah!? Wanna piece of me ‘Octopus lady’?”  
“Why you…”  
  
Banjo calls Misato octopus lady simply because her hands seem like mollusk tentacles moving all over the place. Misato also pinches so hard that Banjo sometimes calls her Mrs. Crabs. It was always raining cats and dogs when Misato and Banjo is around but they get along pretty well. At least that was what the people around them knew. But Misato had been like that ever since, she was a snob to everyone. Except for Michiko though.  
  
Misato and Michiko had been the best of friends back then. They were one seat apart with Banjo at the middle. Misato was a snob to many but with Michiko, she was alright. It was like Michiko has this innate ability to tame a wild beast unknowingly. It might have been her calmness or that soft spoken persona but she gets along with anybody pretty well.  
  
Michiko’s birthday came at last, a lot were expecting something but most of the class were surprised. Michiko’s mom came hours before recess time and talked to their teacher about something, the Teacher called upon Michiko and discussed some matters, and as she went back to her seat, she was smiling.  
  
“huh? Whats going on?” Ryu was curious.  
“Michiko is celebrating her birthday at class, her mom’s gonna treat us with food!” Marina replied.  
“Wow, really Michiko?”  
“Yep, hehehe… ”  
“So what’s it gonna be then? Is it the donuts?” Ritsuki followed  
“Wow donuts! This is gonna be great!” Ryu added.  
“Oh! I really don’t know, she said she’s gonna be back at recess but she didn’t mention what she was bringing with her.” Michiko answered.  
“Cool! I just love surprises…” Banjo mentioned with a really enthusiastic grin.  
“Hey! You are not suppose to be eating any, remember? Hehe” Misato reminded Banjo of what he said the other day.  
“Shut Up Octo-Misato! Hahaha.”  
  
Moments Later, Michiko’s Mom Arrived! She had with her food from the nearby fast food chain Jollibee™ and it was great. The class had spaghetti and fried chicken.  
  
“Would it be nice if it was Michiko’s birthday everyday? I really wish it were… hahaha” Jin said.
