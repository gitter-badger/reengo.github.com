I did a little experiment with the podcast player I made for my website... hope this one works here. Yeah I know, the skin sucks... ehehe. I had limited time to do this since I have no more PC at home so... BEAR with it! eheh.

Its a lightweight flash music player that extracts a playlist from an easy to edit xml file from 1 server and extracts music that I upload from this multiply account... Technically, I'm using multiply's huge storage capacity for my music. If this works, I'll save a lot of space for the podcast station im planning. eheh.

Comments are welcome...
