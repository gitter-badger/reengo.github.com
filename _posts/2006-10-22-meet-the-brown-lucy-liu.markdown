At the MRT, On my way home, A guy sitting next to me was reading an Inquirer LIBRE Newspaper (free newspaper for mrt riders". As he flips on the pages, I saw this article with a catchy title... "Meet the Brown Lucy Liu"... pak it! did Lucy Liu had a tan or something? ehehe. And then I saw the pictures... suddenly I recognized the girl at the left. WTF! its Dennile Lou Valmonte! Binibining Pilipinas International 2006!

As I read the article (without the owners permission) I was not all surprised about seeing an actual write up about her. When I saw her won the pageant aired a few months ago, it didn't surprise me at all. I knew 9 years ago that she was born for it.

I first met Dennile Lou when I was in 2nd year High School, She was a competitor at a contest aptly named "Ginoo at Binibining Pilipinas QCA!" bwehehe. it was like a pageant for pairs on every section on all year levels. Me and my partner Kathleen made it to the finals but unfortunately she and her partner didn't, and well, look at her now! ehehe. She had been my classmate in senior highschool and we often had a chat. I remember one time when she asked me to draw her on a really sexy pose... ehehe. I drew her half naked (or rather 3/4 naked! ehehe) using an id picture for reference and my wild imagination. Her private parts were covered only by a thin sash. and I really enjoyed drawing it **sinister laugh** When I finished drawing her picture, I showed it to her and she liked it.

unfortunately, she still haven't returned the sketchpad, ever since. drats! I could have sold it a high price now that she's famous! ehehe. Lucky for her, I'm not that type of person (but the thought strikes me like a lightning bolt!) ehehe.

I last met her in december 2004 on our highschool reunion at Nat's place and she was HOT! ehehe. lucky for Ungaz, he had a dance with her on our highschool graduation ball! ehehe. too bad I was banned to attend it... crap!

The article was about their send off party for the pageant on who-knows-where! ehehe. I hope for the best for her. Goodluck Chikkah! win the friggin title for us! bwehehe.
