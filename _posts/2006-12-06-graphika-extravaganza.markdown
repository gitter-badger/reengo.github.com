Syet, I woke up late, it was around 8am when I stood up and took breakfast. it would take me 2+ hours to get to Mall of Asia and I was still not moving my ass off. anyways I knew that the program wont actually start at 10am since filipino time is always an hour late. ehehe. however, my body still refuses to hurry up. I came to Mall of Asia at 11:30.

MK12

I arrived at the premiere cinema at about 11:45, mk12 was on. their demo's was staggering and very well done. honestly, I don't hear much about this group until graphika, but they rock. what sucks though is that they were'nt there to personally talk about their stuff. they speak through a friggin web conference from the states because, as Avid would put it, "wala silang bayag" to have the guts to come over here regardless of the typhoon which actually DID NOT hit manila. Joshua Davis came! why cant they? still, their work was great, I was amazed that they weren't using flash at all! crap. I need after effects! ehehe.

Avid Liongoren

Oh yes, my new idol! ehehe. I first heard about this guy making kamikazee's "martyr nievera" video but to my surprise he also did the islander commercial which I am quite amazed of. I learned a lot about his talk, especially when dealing with low budget projects. resourcefulness is the key indeed. ehehe. That backlot thing he thought, I've been really wanting to try that one for ages! hopefully, I could get a project like that at least within this lifetime. ehehe.

Inksurge

These guys look pretty much indie. ehehe. but getting to look at their work fascinated me, especially joyce's illustrations. the intro video also was hillarious. I was thinking of how fun it is to work with them... *brainstorm*

Nico Puertolano

honestly, I find his drips annoying. ehehe. but he does great designs for that coke commercial. I just haven't seen much of his work samples. oh, and the stickers he gave away was too plain boring... anyways, he did made quite an effort to produce that intro video he shown us ehehe.

Black Flood and Constructed Behaviors

I'm still frustrated about that Black flood book sold at their booth. I really wanted to buy that book, only I was short on cash. pakdatshit!Â  its a book of a collection of black and white illustrations from around the world priced at 500 pesos... and I friggin lost the chance to buy that limited edition black flood. I wonder how much it would cost on book stores after the event...

Team Manila

This team kinda reminds me of Culture Crash. They were artists trying to inject the Filipino culture on to their works but somehow always end up looking foreign. I like this group's portfolio though, their stuff was massive and they even had a dj work on background music live using a turntable. they got cool t-shirt designs and great concepts but whats great about this group is that they were proposing with mmda to work on the murals for the MMDA art seen across metro manila. hopefully, they can get gloria to approve. eheh.

Joshua Davis

And yes! the star of the night! ehehe. This guy was a good teacher, his presentation was the most interesting and educational among the rest. I learned a lot from this dude especially the color blurs, ehehe, that one was quite useful. after his talk, a lot of issues came about and we were talking much about stuff we normally dont talk at the office... "follow no one..." yesh... those words hit me like lightning bolt.

and so the conference ended. Shaider, Mayo, and I went to the terminal and ate hen-lin siomai before heading home. we talked much about how work sucks that time. ehehe. how we could have been greater given more productive work. constant multi tasking slows down the honing of your innate talent indeed. like me for example, I do design, css, php programming, and project management all at the same time, and now, I really dont know where I am good at.

It had me thinking about stuff like, what if I pursued my comic artist career? would I be like Avid now? hmm... maybe not. ehehe. I'm not as focused as he is. but eventhough my web design career is somewhat stable now, I still dream of directing my own locally produced animated movie... oh well, wishes... ehehe.
