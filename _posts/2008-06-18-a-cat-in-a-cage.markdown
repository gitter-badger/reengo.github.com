Kittie is starting to lose patience, and I am losing mine as well... but what can I do...? The OMAs think they CAN run my kittie's life since they send her off to school with hard-earned money... PAKKIT! but on the brighter side, they just worry too much for their favorite niece. THEY  PAKKING THINK TOO MUCH!!! and it signals a choke alarm...

Choke factor #1: everytime Kittie leaves home, whether it is for band practice or simply to get some air, they would say: "SAN KA NANAMAN PUPUNTA! NAKOOOOOOO! MAGKIKITA NANAMAN KAYO NI RINGO NOH?"

Choke factor #2: every simple mistake leads to a scolding... with my name in it... "'DI KA NANAMAN  NAKAPAGLABA! PANO HINDI MO MABITAWAN YANG CP MO KAKATEXT KAY RINGO!!!!"

Choke factor #3: my kittie sees a cute kid on street and says, "ang kyut mo naman, kakatuwa ka.." then the OMAs react: "NAKOOOOO! BAT GANYAN KA MAGSALITA, SIGURO GUSTO MO NA MAGKAANAK KAY RINGO NOH!!?"

Choke factor #4: my kittie would be working at the gateway mall soon and she needs to rent bedspace to cut travel time from commuting to school, work and home... but the OMAs refuse, "PAG NAGBOARD KA MAS MADALAS KAYO MAGKITA NI RINGO NYAN! NAKOOOO! MALALAMAN LAMAN NALANG NAMIN..."

Choke factor #5: my kittie would sleep at the OMAs and they would hear kitties mobile phone keypads tapping.. " ANU BA YAN! MATULOG NA NGA KAYO. TEXT PA NG TEXT PATULUGIN MO NARIN NGA YAN SI RINGO!"

With this people might think the OMAs hate me... but they DONT! in fact, they like me so much they give me gifts, serve me the best breakfast and meriendas, they even cook me a fine dinner. but they are just too damn annoying...

I know they love kittie so much and are just worried shit about her ending up getting married in an early age, get pregnant and never graduate college. which in fact, had us hiding within the bushes before getting the blessing that I hoped for in the past couple of years. They like me, but they don't trust me! or even kittie! as if we bang each other to heaven's glory each time we see each other...! If only they knew how this affects my kittie...

Living with the OMAs is also a huge stress factor for my kittie, imagine the pressure she has when she's at home. funny cause we experience the same problem years back until we decided to move out.

...relatives are indeed a pain in the bottom cushion.
