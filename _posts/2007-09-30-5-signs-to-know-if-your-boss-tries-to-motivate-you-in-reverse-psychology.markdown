Cant help but post another random blog tonight... gotta keep myself awake! there's still a lot of work to be done! tsktsk. but anyways, speaking of work. I realized something odd today at a quick meeting we had with my boss. He's actually a master of Reverse Psychology!

_**Reverse psychology** is a persuasion technique involving the false advocacy of a belief or behavior contrary to the belief or behavior which is actually being advocated. This technique relies on the psychological phenomenon ofreactance , in which a person has a negative emotional response in reaction to being persuaded, and thus chooses the option which is being advocated against. - [Wikipedia.com](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_psychology)
_

among the 5 signs I remember since my employment is that, when we are in a meeting and he wants something done quick. Boss would...

1. mock my work, and praise the-person-who I-couldn't-get-along-with in front of me.

2. inform me of an unfortunate possibility of travelling for a business trip outside the country with the-person-who I-couldn't-get-along-with...

3. call me "Champion" in front of the-person-who I-couldn't-get-along-with.

4. tell other people in secret that he's disappointed with my work and make sure I get the message directly from the-person-who I-couldn't-get-along-with...

5. try to come up with a way to get me constantly working togething with the-person-who I-couldn't-get-along-with

... oh well... some random blog this is.
