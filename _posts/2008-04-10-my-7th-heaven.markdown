My 7th Heaven

I have completely lost my grief
Across the sigh is a sound relief
I thank the Lord for the luck that I have
I am so happy that I found you my love

Now we are one, your love and mine
Our fate has gone to intertwine
All the challenge I dare to receive
For you are the strength that inspires me to live

When my lips part from your sweet kiss
You give me a smile and I see bliss
And then it makes me quiver inside
An intense feeling so difficult to hide

I miss you so much you'd feel my sighs
I see your face as i close my eyes
These thoughts that makes my breath so heavy
I couldn't deny, I've fallen so deeply

Mind you not of these things that I say
I just want you to know that I love you each day
You are the best of blessings that God has given
My earth and sky, my 7th heaven.
