I nearly lost my precious cellphone this week... luckily, there are still some kindness and honesty left among taxi drivers around makati...

Yep, I dropped my cellphone on a taxi! when we arrived at the office, I noticed that I could find my cellphone. kimps then tried to call my number to check if I've just dropped it somewhere at the office, when surprisingly, a person answered. the guy told kimps that he got the cellphone. The line got cut and it was my turn to call. The driver answered and we had a conversation, he promised that he would return the cellphone but its just that he had a passenger already on board and are on their way to shangrila.

I had doubts that my cellphone would not be returned. I thought of all the wonderful things that happened with me using that cellphone... I loved that phone...

minutes later, after waiting at the entrance of our office building, the taxi arrived. The driver went back WITH a passenger on board and gave me the cellphone i dropped. then I gave him a 200 peso cash reward. (cheap huh? ehehe). the driver was in a hurry since he got a non-filipino passenger, great effort.

I think of a few reason's though why he returned it despite the fact that he could just ignore my call and keep my phone for himself...

1. he was impressing the foreigner
2. he was expecting a reward (or atleast larger than what I gave.. ehe)
3. he don't like a crappy old nokia2310 phone...eheh. or
4. he's just kind and honest.

At any rate, the guy's an angel. Stuff on my cellphone are vital to me, plus the phone and I had been through a lot! it survived falling on a moving jeepney, got broken when I decided to have it open-line, torture tested with continuous spinning habbit. eheh. and excessive smart sms's.. but thank God its back... I saved the taxi's plate number, but I accidentally deleted it when I did a cp housecleaning.. eheh.

oh well, Thanks to you manong driver. you changed my bad impression of taxi drivers... mabuhay ka! ehe.
