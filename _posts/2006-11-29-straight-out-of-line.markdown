I know Im not suppose to blog for at least a month to concentrate more on work but I just gotta let this one out...

Straight Out of Line?

Im feeling a bit lost yesterday, work was very depressing that brought my morale down at full speed. dont get me wrong, I love my work. but sometimes, its not the work load that burns me out. its the intense time pressure that eats me alive. I can handle one full week of overtimes and you wont hear me complain. just dont let me feel I am incompetent.

I was assigned to handle 3 major projects last week and on all projects, I am also the designer and one of which I also do programming. my task was to ensure good quality outputs (QA), deliver best results the fastest way possible and communicate with one of the clients as project coordinator. I started working on project #1 early on and finished the desgin on time. Then the deadline for project #2 arrived. I focused more on that project and left the other behind since it was not THAT urgent. working halfway through project #2, the deadline for project #3 arrived. to add up to the pressure, I needed to prepare for a demo of that project scheduled today (nov 29). needless to say, I AM DOOMED!

Dilemmaton

while working on project #3 (since it has the earliest deadline), I was performing QA stuff on project #2. when all of a sudden, my boss informed me that she was reassigning project #1 to others since I got my hands full... good or bad?

we had a meeting for a project I was working on a month earlier, It was a super major project that needed attention. I had been instructed some tasks that I was waiting for quite a while but the boss held back and said "oh, you dont need to do this now, I'll assign this to others because I know your load is full..." good or bad?

Still working on project #3 (since the deadline is the next day, and I am to present it personally to the client), I squeezed out my brain juices figuring out stuff and having the program to actually work. when all of a sudden, my officemate informed me that the boss reassigned project #2 to her since I had lots of work to be done... good or bad?

I know I may have caused delays because of the projects I am handling but becoming a leader and at the same time a team player is friggin hard work! It was coaching basketball and playing on the hardcourt at the same time ala Jaworski! I understand that my boss' concerns was for my own sake, and it is! since my work load was lessened, but it was just so depressing. it was like... "I am taking this project away from you because you suck...!"

I think I'm Paranoid

It may be paranoia but I was assuming that my superiors didn't trust that I can finish the project well on time. and so, maybe I really can't! but I just hate the fact that I wasn't able to finish the project that I worked so hard with and with me as the team leader! If they weren't happy with what I did then they shouldn't have stockpiled projects with multiple job descriptions for me to work with. just let me be team leader! and not team leader/web designer/project coordinator/content developer...

my only concern was that if you want me to lead. then just let me lead! dont be afraid that I will screw you up because even if I lack the skills, I WILL find a way to get those skills no matter what!

No offense to my boss, I still think she's the best boss in the world (far greater than my previous boss, ehehe). It's just that I felt like I was laid off the team...

Oh well, angst released... feels much better... However, I still need to talk to her about this, I really dont want this to go on. and me feeling like SYET! all the time. ehehe.
