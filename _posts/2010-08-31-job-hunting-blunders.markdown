Finally, after a lot of depressing job application failures and frustrating rejections. I got hired as a Flash Developer on a decently large company. This is great since I really wanted to do flash development ever since my career started in IT. It was also the job I applied for on my previous company until they told me to take the managerial position instead since I already have experience and they need some with those qualities badly.

But it was never an easy win on this job. I went through a lot interviews and exams before I got hired. It was a lot tougher for me since I do not actually have a definite expertise since I was doing stuff on a lot of fields. A jack-of-all-trades you might say but definitely a master of none.

Anyways, the following are some job hunting experiences that you might learn something from:

**Blunder #1: A well known Japan based gaming company in Makati - Position: Flash Expert**

This could have been a great job, **sigh** but I think it was really not for me. I've gone through phone interview, initial screening interview, interview with the Art director, written exam And a Flash AS3 coding and design practical exam. I passed them all except for one, the interview with the genius Japanese president (I still remember the name but I'm not mentioning. eheh).

He was asking me super advanced stuff that I could not answer, too advanced for me I guess. He was asking about sockets, jabber (which I am not familiar with until recently), and building stuff I never though was possible at that time... It was hell, since I actually haven't answered a single question correctly! Instead, I pointed out that whatever needs to be done that I am not familiar with, I can learn and do something in the shortest possible time... but I guess.. it was not enough for him.

**Blunder #****2: A startup Canada/Hongkong based gaming company in Makati - Position: Flash Developer**

Since the start of this engagement, they already pointed out that they cannot afford what I am asking. But anyways, they let me finish the process and think about it. I diligently go through the interviews with the HR Manager and the General Manager as well as a practical exam IN PAPER! they had me write a code in paper which was friggin hard! but I think I got it right though... I havent got a call from them since.

**Blunder #****3: A BPO/CallCenter in Ortigas - Position: IT Project Manager**

Yep, I also applied as a project manager since it was my current position. I thought that applying for the position could give a me better chance of getting a job. Since its a project manager position, I was in business attire with my long hair tied up in a bun. eheh. I've gone through the interviews and exams without any practical exam since it was a managerial position and after a while, they told me to keep my lines open for a possible call when I get to be interviewed by the president... I knew right there and then that they don't want me in... sheesh.

**Blunder #****4: A Europe based gaming company in Ortigas - Position: Project Manager**

This one is a blood boiler. I was invited for an interview for the project manager position until I got there and told me that what they were actually looking for was a senior PHP Developer. The interviewer (with quite an attitude) asked me if I still wanted to apply for the developer position. I told him yes since I also do PHP coding and I would really take chances to get a job... BIG MISTAKE!!! I've gone through with the interview with sarcasm and lot of developer-to-project-manager-angst until we got to a point where I mentioned OOP and MVC. He then asked me a weird question in MVC and got the answer correctly with a yes, and then he asked... "why?".

A slight dead air followed with me thinking (What the hell is this guy's problem!?) and then he asked,

"What do think MVC stands for?" I answered Model View Class... err... then he was like,

"MODEL VIEW CONTROLLER!!!" when I was just about to correct my self with the "class" thing, drats.

"See, how can you answer my question if you don't even know what MVC stands for".

I feel like I was talking to a guy who did not have a good sleep for along time.. I went out of their office with a closed fist.

**Blunder #****5: Another Europe-based gaming company in Makati - Position: Web Designer**

Hey, I started out as a Web Designer why not try this again right? and so I did. A friend and colleague recommended me here, I had a positive vibe on the application process. I got interviewed well, passed the exams and all and asked me to work on a take-home exam to design 2 website mockups in 4 days. I submitted my entries crossing my fingers, and well... did not hear anything from them ever since, even my friend who works there dont have a clue. He said no one has been hired for the position until now... I wonder what went wrong...

**Blunder #****6: An outsourcing company in Makati - Position: Web Designer**

This actually got my interest since they were actually interviewing me for a different client. I researched the client and it was decent. However, after some evaluation, they sent me an email:

_"This is to inform you that our client, [Design Company] feedback is that youâ€™re overqualified for the position. Therefore, we can no longer continue your application for the Web Designer position."_

**Blunder #****7: A prominent IT solutions firm in Makati - Position: Graphics Illustrator**

I figured, why not try this job since drawing is my innate skill... I got interviewed twice and was given a take home exam. I had to draw in FRIGGIN VECTOR! using Illustrator. I really suck in illustrator but I tried my best... and well.. It was never enough.

**Blunder #****8: A premier magazine company in Mandaluyong - Position: IT Project Manager**

Yeah, after a lot of advice from friends, I decided to look out for project manager jobs again.. but why do I always encounter interviewers with attitudes? These interviewers should not take personal problems on job interviews, it could mean psychological harm... tsktsk. Anyways the first parts of the interview were good, until we reach to a point where we argue about the models of SDLCs. A big NO NO on job interviews, NEVER ARGUE WITH THE INTERVIEWER! anyways, I just aired my opinion but he blatantly disagreed. After so, he was asking me...

"So, what you do think you can do that other candidates don't."

I answered politely with my skills and all those that you could read on job interviews 101. and yet he answered while browsing over my resume...

"What else...?"

This what else thing went on for like almost 10 times! until I asked

"What answer are you looking for?"

The interview ended bad but still I had a good lesson learned... sheesh.

**SUCCESS!: Finally, a Europe-based gaming company in Eastwood - Position: Flash Developer**

With all the lessons learned from above, and all the experiences I had. I went through all application procedures very smoothly, the phone interview, initial interview, 2 foreign client interviews a written exam and a Flash AS3 practical exam until finally, I GOT THE JOB THAT I REALLY WANT!

With all these experiences I know that I could love my job even more, because if I loose it again, I might end up going through this hell again. I sure hope you've learned a thing or two on this blog. Finding a job nowadays is friggin difficult, so love your job... but dont fall in love with it.. eheh.
