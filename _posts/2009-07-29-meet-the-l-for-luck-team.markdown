Behind the curtain is a team of highly skilled programmers and marketing associates standing-up from their own field of expertise to develop this one of a kind product.

**The Project Manager**

Following through a solid foundation established by project management colleagues Fitz Vanessa Lim and Aura Krishna Villena, Ringo Bautista takes over the management of the LforLuck project with utmost enthusiasm. His previous engagement to the technical development of accounting systems, quality control and compliance auditing allowed him to quickly blend in to the online Parimutuel Betting and Fixed-odds gambling scene.

**The Technical Lead**

The complexity of bookmaker systems and online fixed odds gambling has never been a problem to the team's highly acclaimed lead programmer. Oliver Lozada is an experienced system core developer whose work varies from the authoring of accounting systems to card processors and has now been shifted to a more mind-bending project that is Lforluck. The philosophy and wit of this complex thinker makes him a sturdy foundation of the Lforluck development team.

**The Architect**

Teamed up with Oliver and his eyes of hawk in logical reasoning, Norlan Semera has been the brains of the Lforluck project. While this jack of all trades in programming is simultaneously leading the technical development of the BETENGIN--rechargeplus' premier online wagering engine--Norlan is considered as the genius behind the idea of the new Lforluck insfrastructure to which is now standing out to be the most comprehensive online betting portal on the internet today.

**The Specialist**

Trained and focused on gaming projects development, Rodel Dimaculangan has already become a well versed gaming programmer handling The Odds Broker (TOB) project with minimal supervision from superiors Norlan and Oliver. Being a cheery fast learning programmer with a noticeably vibrant smile, Rodel has contributed a number functions on Lforluck even on his junior programmer ranking days with the project. He is also the team's programming hitman and resident bug fixer of gaming projects.

**The Adept**

Mark Julius Vila is a new addition to the lforluck crew coming from the team behind gamingÂ  back office and reconcilliation development projects. Mark is rapidly becoming an adept with the new innovative structure of lforluck and has vastly contributed a considerable amount of work on the MMX project, Lforluck's Multimedia Content Management System. His keen sense of logic and a similar working attitute with his superiors Kram is considered as an unpredictable genius with an anticipating future.

**The Apprentice**

Following the brilliant minds of Norlan and Oliver, this new addition to the team is surely making his way to becoming a product of good training by his superiors. Dave Santiago is on his way to expand his expertise in programming from mobile software development to server side scripting in Hypertext Pre-Processor Language (PHP). With great enthusiasm on the concept of Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP), this former mobile team member is bound for many great things through this Lforluck project.
