Monday, No Work, Yeahbah!
yep,its a monday and we dont have work, Sweeeeet! Our boss allowed us to have this day off in place for the Ramadan holiday last october 24. however, it seems as though the day would be more hectic than it looks.

I started the day late waking up at around 2:00pm! (I really miss oversleeping alot!) I ate lunch while watching Bulagaan and checked my phone for messages after. And to my surprise, there were 14 messages! mostly from kittie, she was asking about the long neck plastic bottle she needed for flairing practice in school... sadly, my mom sold 'em all for 50 cents a piece! ehehe. sorry dude.

Rehearsal
I arrived at the studio at 3:50 and pakkit! there were no signs of my bandmates! we were scheduled at 4pm and there are other bands scheduled after we finish. If we dont play at 4, we would have to pray that the next band backs out or we play at 8pm! After some chitchat and tekken (ehehe) the band was complete at 4:30. but still, we have to wait until 5pm and if the scheduled band wont appear on time, we take their sked. and so we did! ehehe.

After a fun rehearsal, birthday boy Slash offered to treat me dinner! ehehe, but only me he says, bweheheh. we ate lugaw, tokwa and siopao and then took a couple more tekken matches before heading to chow's place. the band was ready to go for the gig.

The Holloween Gig
We arrived at the venue, and there were lots of people staring at us. It was like entering a tribe of cannibals and we were on the dinner menu! the place was said to be dangerous and the residents were like war freaks asking fights here and there. the gate has a notice of rules and regulations and ofcourse the performing bands... holy crap! our band name was there! bwehehe. so we went to the entrance as soon as we could and entered a covered court with lots of room for a mosh pit. We saw the audio equiptments and the drumset to be of good quality... thank goodness...

As we chat around new found friends, the first band to perform asked to borrow Jnaut's guitar. oh well, At least I could borrow their bass. ehehe. The band's name was Ganja Band (I think, ehehe) they only played 2 songs and left their instruments on stage. they said they would play again later... fair enough. Next was Shot, This group was a Bamboo cover band and was really good! the drummer and vocalist was very much Bamboo and they played their music clean. They played 5 BAmboo hits, and the crowd was wild. It was a great performance.

On Stage
And yes, it was our turn to rock the stage. But whats this? Slash got no guitar strap? it took us a while to borrow from other bands but pakkit! they said they dont have any!? we even tried announcing on stage but we were let down. sheesh! we let others borrow our guitars and effects and they wont let us borrow their straps!? before we loose good mood, Slash sat on stage instead holding his strapless guitar and was ready to play. We played Art of Letting go by Valley of Crome first and though the song was played well, the crowd was like "where the heck did that song come from!", next was Slither from Velvet Revolver, again the crowd was idle! sheeeth!, by then we figured, our lineup sucks! ehehe. And then we began the Payaso intro... whoa! now here is where the crowd gets wild! ehehe. youth rockers began the "slamman" thing on the moshpit as we continue performing. holy shit, now this is what you call a gig! ehehe. Payaso by Razorback may not be as famous as Narda or Hallelujah, but its still good ol fashioned pinoy rock. and luckily, most of the crowd appreciates it. the "Slamman" however, caused a commotion at the corner but it was resolved. knowing that tagalog songs will get the crowd's attention, we decided to play a tagalog compo - Grasaman. and well, the crowed may look as though they really like the song but they dont seem to be excited enough to show it. drats.

Enjoying the Night
After our performance, more great bands followed. The Ganja Band continued their lineup with Martir Nievera! the crowd wnt wild again, sheesh. we should have chosen Doobidoo or Chiksilog or even Ordertaker for a lineup... at least now we know. ehehe. the next band has a female vocalist. I like this band, they played Cranberries' Zombie and Evanescence's Bring me to life and they were good... but I forgot the name of the band. ehehe. shame on me. An Emo band followed, covering songs from Dashboard Confessionals and was followed by a Kamikazee cover band. and well, the crowd loved them. oh well, at least we enjoyed playing.

The Chikaz
yep, there were lots of chickies, and sadly lots of chiksilogs! ehehe. it was a holloween party and hideous "Baklang Matons" roam the place. We met this girl who said she was the vocalist of a certain band and she was nice. funny thing is, I only remembered the name of one chick. ehehe. maybe because kittie was texting me most of the time. And so the gig ended and we enjoyed the night. Its the first time that we've played on a huge crowd. eheh.
Slash's Birthday

We continued the fun at Ry's place and had a drink. Darnit, I drank too much that night that my allergies went wild. aside from that, a lot has happened on this drinking session that drew me on a bad mood. however, the day was quite something.

Oh well... so much for monday... the next gig will be on Nov. 4... hopefully, we could do it right this time...
