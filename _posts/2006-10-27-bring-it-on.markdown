Yup this friday sure is hectic! I really don't know if I should celebrate or not! ehehe.

As of today, I am now a regular employee at I"s (not the real company name, ehehe).Yep! my 6 months of probationary employment has ended, WEEEEEE!!!. Meaning, I get 2 days off a week, my salary increased, current position lifted, and more respect from officemates gained. ehehe. However, its like I am about to engage into a war and I only have a spoon... for a weapon... a spoon... pakkit! wanna know why?

1. We have a new contract from a client and we need to design 50 friggin websites for only 5 friggin weeks! pakkit! that's 10 websites a week!Â  we only need to do the design part, development is from the client's framework but still that's 10 websites a week! sheesh, how am I gonna deal with that!? I need to develop a fast paced production procedure or else... I'm dead!

2. I still need to work for 48 hours a week. So technically, I am about to work for 9.6 hours a day in place for another day off... 9.6 hours a day... drats... If I am to leave the office at 8:00pm, I would be home at 11:00pm, and that doesn't count as overtime!

3. I am really not that confident enough to handle management as much as I handle designing. so I am a bit hessitant... but I love challenges and the more you challenge me, the better I become... but... am I worth it? I mean, I am the king of tardiness at the office and I friggin blog at work! bwehehe. anyways... might as well take the challenge.

4. I've only worked for 6th months at the office and I seem to be climbing the ladder too fast. Experiencewise, I don't think I am well equiped... sheesh, makes me nervous.

Whats great is that, tomorrow is my first saturday off! ehehe. holy crap! that means I have no work for 6 days! 28, 29, 30, 31, 1, 2! ehehe. And if I work on friday next week, I'll be off on saturday again! bwehehe. ALRIGHTY!

Ok, enough bragging, ehehe.

I got lots of plans this week... we have a 1 gig before the month ends, a house party at novaliches. ehehe. gotta lay off some steam... relax and enjoy the vacation. ehehe. because when I do get back to work... I could die...
