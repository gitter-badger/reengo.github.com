Link tracker is a simple crawling tool for tracking links within a webpage. Link tracker checks if the link is in the correct search engine friendly format, whether it has a no_follow attribute or not and what anchor text was used to display the link. You can export your results in an excel file as needed.

The tool is still on its beta version but you can try it out freely and evaluate how it can help your SEO work. [Try Link Tracker Now](http://www.reengo.com/rgb/linktracker_v0_7) by clicking on the image below and please do send in some comments or suggestions if you have any.
