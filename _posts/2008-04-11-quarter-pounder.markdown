10. Ecopark Trip with Friends
We started the year with a picnic trip at The Ecopark Fairview QC. this was also the first time I saw Van cry! (naligaw! tsktsk) bwehehe. The fun continues as Me, Jill, Van, Little Foot, her nephew and Gijeno1 ventures the crowded mall of Trinoma and wasted money at Timezone! eheh. The fun didn't last though. before we left, I heard a heartbreaking news from Van...

Marimar, Jamaimahhh and I continued the fun at SM Fairview and helped Jamaimahhh improve her tekken skills! after so... I met up with Jill and the gang again to attend Jeff's Birthday... we went home wasted. at least I got a chance to meet new friends.

A memorable trip to Los Banos Laguna for a Gig at LB Bistro with Idol bands Triangle Trauma, Jeff Pagaduan and Redfills. The Band then settled the night over at Marimar's Boyfriend's place at Sta. Cruz Laguna. It has been a fun gig, though Jill got grounded as she went back home. she even had her buko pie (pasalubong) thrown at her face! (pasalubong sa muka! bwehehe).

7. Jumong's Birthday Extravaganza
"Great move... great beer.." Bwehehe. Jumong's birthday was indeed a blast since we got to hang out with the office's marketing team (the chikas). Plus, we got to figure out whose "tupperware" or not. bwehehe. the boys also got "happier" after the party. whoohoo!!!

6. Cebu Trip
I got part of the marketing team's business trip to Cebu. got lotsa firsts on that trip, first flight via PAL, first visit in Cebu, first buffet breakfast lunch and dinner, first time to see the boss in action (syet! idol!!!), nice trip.. I also bought for me and my kittie an authentic cebuano fine-crafted acoustic guitar! whoohoo! top notch!

5. Dev Team Boys Night Out
It was Kokik's Birthday and a semi despedida party for his flight to who-knows-where. ehehe. Food was treated at the office to fill our crazy tummies. Next, we drank booze at gilligan's glorieta to prep ourselves for the main event. Next, we head off to a videoke riot in music 21 jupiter st. Next, we got spent. ehehe. we haven't even got to the main event... tsktsk. theres always a next time though. Still, it was the best dev team boys bonding to date.

4. Incubus!!! 
Watched the Incubus concert at Araneta Cubao with friends. It was one helluva great time! shit, I wish Red Hot Chili Peppers would be next.

Finally my sister graduated the nursing course... shit. I thought the tuition fee nightmares would never end... My sister's diploma was indeed the best trophy in the world for me... hopefully she passes the board exams though! bwehehehe. Gogogo!

1. Happiest Easter Ever!
Friends... OK. Bestfriend... OK. Siblings... OK. Mom...Â  OK. Old-fashioned-old-maid-aunts-who's-too-scared-for-their-niece-to-have-a-boyfriend... OK. All hindrances and Impediments were squashed! and after an almost-neverending struggle, we finally got all the blessings we need.... Kittie and I are now engaged.... JOKE! We just got official... and it was the happiest easter ever!

Oh well... shit. all the nicest things happened in March... the luckiest month ever. I just wish that I was the one who won the 245 Million Peso Lotto Jackpot to maximize that luck... eheh.
