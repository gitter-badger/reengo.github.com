This Game is getting more exciting that it ever was... Charlie Nash is back!

Whats even more interresting is how the story line progresses. As we all know, Guile is looking for Charlie who was presumed dead. Killed by sacrificing himself to kill bison after being brainwashed to do Shadaloo stuff for Bison. they both fell off a cliff... some drama... both of them died... but Bison recovered... and now Charlie's back! 

It could be that someone revived him. probably whats left of SIN or something else. Judging from the stitches and Frankenstein-like look... he could have been an experiment as well... Probably not by Shadaloo though. Why would Bison even bother reviving him after all that has happened. :D

This new Charlie looks a lot like the first marvel vs. capcom where he was called Shadow but this version is way way more cooler! those teleports that Ultra-ish shadowy cynematic finish... this could be a favorite. :D
