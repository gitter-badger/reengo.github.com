**Friday
**It was supposedly OUR day, the 23rd... this influenza got me thursday night and I was hoping it be gone by weekend and yet... we'd both been sick. I felt weaker and weaker as I finish work, and headed for snooze-time as fast as I could. my head was heavy, as I left my house mates and went to the condo alone. I fixed myself, jumped to bed and then She called...

Just Wednesday we agreed not to see each other on OUR day for some odd reason. She's been hearing the old maids say stuff about me that offends her... whatever that is, she doesn't want to hear something like it again. So she thought that not seeing each other for awhile would shut the old maids' mouths. A fitting sacrifice to protect my interest she says... romantic, yes... and well... very touching.I've spend my sick Friday night in bed early, talking to my kittie on the phone till sleep gets us. And then, OUR day ended simple yet memorable.****

**SATURDAY**
Waking up in the morning with a smile on my face was very rewarding. My kittie asked to pick me up at the condo and went back home at Novaliches together since I was sick and she was worried. I had the biggest smile in the world that morning. She was as sick as me and yet she offered to pick me upon the other side of the world just to make sure I'll be fine... sweet.

"Basta ha, wag ka na pasaway jan, kain ka na breakfast tapos inom ka gamot, tulog ka saglit tapos gising ka ulit para mag lunch. tapos hintayin mo ko ha... punta ko jan. pagaling ka mahal ko, I love you.." 

She arrived about 4pm. I was already packed up and ready to go home. When she arrived, we had chitchats and small talks with the house mates and Marv's new guest. If i can remember it right, I think his name was Jarvin. We spent time with the house mates and played tekken 5 until night was about to fall. Marlon payed a visit so I introduced him to my kittie princess. We went home together after eating dinner at Jollibee and went past SM Fairview, She greeted her French Baker friends and then we head home.

At home we spent a few more time before she left. She had a sneak peak on how my mom works my Vintuza (if the spelling is correct.) and then rode a trike and went home.****

**SUNDAY**
Sunday afternoon came and she was ready for a night swimming reunion with her high school friends. She went to my place and we saw each other again for a few more minutes then we set off, She to her reunion and me to the condo.Â  We shopped for outing essentials first at liza's before parting ways... and then a few minutes later... I missed her so much...

At this rate, I'm really thankful to have such a thoughtful girlfriend. efforts like these melts my heart real fast. It was indeed a touching weekend for me and She was definitely my best blessing.
