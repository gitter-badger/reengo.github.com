Wait 
Pronunciation: \'w?t\
Function: verb

transitive verb 
1: to wait in place in expectation of...

Expectation of what!? sheesh! yesterday was the crappiest I"s office moment I've ever experienced in my entire career.. tsktsk. Before I left the office I somehow forgot how pissed off I was since I was with couples Choknat and Nougat (ehehe) but darnit, yesterday was just so lame...

I arrived at the office with my officemates outside. chatting. There was no friggin electricity on a highly stable building! 2 floors were not supplied by electricity and so, we could not resume work. Normally, companies would have suspended work hours since the office was not available but NO...! we were ordered to wait for until lunch time for a finalized decision... So fine, we wait.

Choknat and I decided to play a little network gaming at the nearby internet cafe and Silverbone came along. we had moments of more crappy gaming since we only get to play CS sheesh. Nougat came near lunchtime to invite us to lunch. I thought the office was going to treat us lunch but I was wrong...

Choknat treated me lunch that time. lucky me. eheh. But then, when we had to return to the office at 1:30 for a so-called general meeting. I really was hoping that I could just go home and sleep! The meeting took place at the deck where the pool was. As the meeting started, all we could talk about was more office work... Deadlines and crap came about. what's worse is the obvious fact that most of us appeared to have not enjoying work much lately. It saddens me that general meetings always ends up this way and I really think the office needs to do something about it.

The meeting ended and we played a little game called "pinoy henyo".. well, at some point it was fun. But If you get the idea, that we were held off to play a game and waste time WAITING for the friggin electricity to came back... It sucks. I tried taking a nap at the deck though, but it only took me a fraction of a second. eheh.

We won the game... and the prize? large cones of ice cream... darnit. I was expecting a full course meal at least. Pizza, would also be nicer. sigh. and to top it all off, we had to brainstorm for ideas on a new BIG project while the office was INACCESSIBLE. and after long hours of waiting. Motohime Sakura came to us as and cheerfully said, "20 Minutes nalang pala may kuryente na!" ... Grr... Badnews indeed. IT WAS 5:00PM!

In the end we still had to work even if the electricity went back 2 hours before office hours end. Reason? we had to work with the deadlines. And the deadlines hit me indeed when I took a glance at my inbox. sheesh.

Bottomline is, I really hate the fact that we had to wait and rush things in the end. Ice cream was really not enough and we should have been dismissed early on. I felt like I've wasted an awful lot of time for bad news and more frustrations.

What saddens me the most is when Lily announced her resignation. though she told me this ahead of time, I still could think how things will go about at the office when she's gone. I do expect a lot more work for me, more HARD clients... but from now on. EVERYTHING has to be worth MY time!
