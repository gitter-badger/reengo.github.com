Some couple of weeks ago, I noticed that quite a handful of friends are using an old cartoon image as a profile picture. After a while, I stumbled upon this one:


<blockquote>Change your facebook profile picture to a cartoon from your childhood and invite your friends to do the same. Until Monday (Dec. 6) there should be no human faces on facebook but an invasion of memories. This is a campaign against violence for children. Please spread the word....</blockquote>


And so I started to change mine. I first thought of something hilarious that could draw a bit of attention... [Captain Planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Planet_and_the_Planeteers)! (Go Planet!). I quickly changed it into something I really like since it was a bit too gay... eheh. I chose [Mask Rider Black (Kamen Rider Black in Japan)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_Black) next but then again, it was not a cartoon rather a Sentai action series. So I dug deeper into my childhood memories and remembered this one anime that I liked so much I even played and finished a NES RPG in Japanese (even if I can't read Japanese).... [YAIBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaiba)!

And so, after having some fun, watching my facebook page turn into a catalog of old and almost forgotten cartoons from friends' profiles that shaped my childhood, I saw this movie:

Quite touching... and then I made a quick research, who the hell started this campaign that made everyone I know support it? I then found out that there weren't really any real life campaign against violence on children going on. It's even possible that this call was actually the one that inspired a real life campaign after all. This campaign made people support, react and do something as little as changing one's own profile pic into a childhood cartoon character, helping people become aware of the fact that there are abused children around the world and its number growing by the minute... and its a good thing. But for a moment, I was thinking...

So we had our little fun reminiscing old childhood memories by this intriguing [meme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme), the question is: "Now what!?"

Aren't we supposed to do something to help these children? or are we just really following a trend?
