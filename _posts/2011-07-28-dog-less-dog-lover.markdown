So I've watched this video from Youtube about 'talking' dogs... Adorable, aren't they? Each time I see something like these though, I feel more of a heartbreak.



I've always loved dogs, even cats! any animal in the world even! But somehow, fate doesn't seem to want me to have one as a pet. Or maybe its the society I live in...

I've had 7 Dogs in my current lifetime, and all of them was taken away from me. mostly on the worst scenario

**1. Brownie**

I couldn't remember much from this guy since I was about 4 years old when we got separated. I left him from the visayan province of Leyte in the Philippines and lived in Manila for good. but still, I can recall faint memories of how this guy took care of me when I was a kid.

**2. Patras**

Even if named after a famous male canine  from Japanese Anime of the 90's, Patras was actually female! She was with us for some years from a puppy to a mother.

Patras was a smart and obedient dog, but after she gave birth to another set of puppies, she somehow snapped. She ATE some of her puppies abdomens and got very moody and would nearly bite people getting near the remaining puppies. she got wilder and wilder until we decided to get rid of her... my mom however decided to sell her to dog-eating bystanders down the street... one that I couldn't really do anything about. Sad to say, in a society I lived in back then... its a normal thing.

**3. Fritzie**

Patras brought 2 great puppies that remained with us for a while, we named them Fritzie and Macho. Fritzie was memorable for me for an incident concerning worms... :D Anyways, she was actually given to my cousin's girlfriend but wasn't able to take care of her so we took her back. Fritzie was as smart as her mother but unfortunately, she was sickly. She became sick one day which eventually got worse, but instead of looking for a vet to cure her, she had the same fate as her mother... I was 12 that time and all I could do was cry.

**4. Macho**

I fought over Macho and took care of the guy, he stayed with us for quite a while and I made sure he wouldn't have the same fate as what his family had. Macho was with us when we moved home. Macho was a good looking dog and was loved by our neighbors since he's smart and playful. but just when I thought everything would be okay... my father went home from abroad as an OFW.

When my dad went home, Macho was already very cautious. he often barks at my dad and tries his best to prevent him from entering the house. He does not bite though so he wasn't really dangerous.

One night, my dad went downstairs and had a pee. suddenly Macho went upstairs on his room and started barking like crazy in the middle of the night! its like saying "Get out of here old man! you don't belong here!" My dad was so furious, he was shouting downstairs, calling up to me to restrain my dog... I woke up and found my dog frightened to death! couldn't guess what was going on until I found out that he pissed on my father's bed! while my dad was downstairs taking a pee. :D

The next morning, I was shocked to see my dog lying on the floor spitting blood... My dad immediately told me to get rid of my dog because he was sick and that it may be contagious. I was clueless and angry but I couldn't stand up to my father, I ended up carrying Macho outside where all the neighbors were watching. My dad called a tricycle driver and offered my dying dog for God-knows-what! I went running back home angry as hell and marked that very day when my father killed my bestfriend. Up until now, I still suspect that he poisoned Macho with "Vetsin" a food taste enhancer which kills dogs in a whim.

**5. Aiko**

Aiko then arrived a few years later when my dad went back to the middle east. She was a cute dog and a great company. we had her for months until someone stole her... not sure if she also ended up on other people's digestive system or someone else really stole her and took care of her. hopefully its the latter.

**6. Toji**

My bestfriend gave me a puppy when I was in highschool, I named him Toji. Toji was a dog that lived with us from a lot of different places. since we moved again twice, Toji was taken care of by my cousins until we finally finished moving to the new house. Toji looks really cool with his black and white fur that almost looked like a suit. having him wear a bow tie made him look like the James bond of the canine world!

Toji has a talent for opening gates, and I'm not talking about wooden and easy to open gates, I mean thick metal gates. He's also very furious with people in blue, probably since he hated the village's security guards roaming around and pointing shotguns at him when he successfully opens the gate and run wild.

we always get a complaint from neighbors because of Toji but it didn't matter. until my cousin's girlfriend, a **cynophobic** (_one that has Fear of dogs or rabies), _got pregnant and lived with us. My mom decided to dispose the guy and let a village guard take care of him. I was really hoping that he really was gonna be taken care of. But I heared he ended up on a dining table on a drinking session of security guards...

The last moment we had before giving him to the guards, I pinched his cheeks like I used to and said sorry for everything. He simply looked me in the eyes, scared but calm, as if he's telling me... "Its okay boss, its for your own sake..."

**7. Chico**

Scared that the next pet dog would end up on the menu again, we weren't able to have one for quite some time. Until my girlfriend had me take care of a puppy, we named him Chico. our lives had fun again with this crazy lovable companion. until the neighbor got envious and started complaining about the dog. Me and the landlord already had an agreement to have a dog in the house as long as there wouldn't be any complaint. But here it is again... neighbors and circumstances going against me taking care of a canine companion...

I didn't let anything happen to Chico even if he has to be moved out of the house. We had my girlfriend's uncle take care of him on his huge house. Thankfully, Chico is well been taking care of, still the lively one and still in tip top shape with all the other playful dogs there.

It was a great relief when I visited him, but it suddenly became a bit sad when Chico got really excited and seem like he missed me so much and wants to come with me. but I had to let him stay there... close my ears to prevent me from hearing his loud barks that almost begs me to take him home... I went out there with a heartbreak. but at least I know that some day soon, I can still visit the guy and play fetch with a drool covered slipper.



Right now, I'm not considering on taking care of a new dog as long as I settle in a place where I could state my own rules! no more pets will die in my hands for as long as I live... and It's a promise I'm willing to make in respect for the 7 Dogs that made my childhood worthwhile .
