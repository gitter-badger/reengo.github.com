And so... it ended. or maybe not. What began on October 6 would end at the 7th of December. Michiko decided to take the 2 month exile that she wanted. Exile, in the sense that she will move farther away from the 2 hopefuls who desperately wanted to be with her. She needed that 2 months to finally make up her mind. She couldn't be trapped in a concealed place of unearthly confusion for the rest of her life. She needed to know something... She needed to know how she was feeling, and if the feeling is right. What path she really wanted to take... she needed 2 months to decide.  
  
The Story began 15 years ago, when both Michiko and Ritsuki was in 3rd grade at St. Mathew Parochial School. They were both lively at their age, both were innocent. Ritsuki was 3 months older and was born under zodiac Gemini. Michiko on the other hand was a Virgo. They don’t normally talk that much to each other back then, they only knew each other as a classmate to another… but the memories they had were all good ones. Michiko was transferred to St. Mathew from another Elementary school and haven’t got much friends at the moment. Michiko was an introvert, a shy and silent young girl who would rather smile most of the time. It was that smile of hers that was most memorable to Ritsuki, a smile that had created an anchor for Michiko on Ritsuki’s mind, an anchor point that had brought Ritsuki in the past 15 years later.  
  
Ritsuki and Michiko had been classmates for 4 years and eventually became close friends at 6th grade. They were seated 1 row apart. Ritsuki was in front while Michiko was at his back. They were a lively group as the seating arrangement were not changed throughout the school year. Ritsuki was in fact an introvert too. Yet he was more adventurous, he was adaptable to any company quickly and at a small amount of time, He can make friends. There may be a time where he was silent but most of the time he would just go with the flow. Ritsuki never had a great time grooming himself at childhood. He would just wander about the day not worrying how his hair would look like as he goes against the wind of the 5 story corridor of their classroom. On the other hand, Michiko was the opposite. She wears cute random hair bands on her shoulder-length hair with bangs covering the forehead. This is what she looks like for every single day of her 6th grade school year, that when she doesn’t, people would really notice something different from her. Michiko and Ritsuki weren’t that much of a high profiler at school, but they were good students… fun loving 6th graders at that.  
  
Ritsuki was seated with the class president Jin at his left. Jin was a lively young girl and a responsible class leader. Though she might be as strict as a preschool teacher, she was quite a looker, with a deep dimple up her cheeks and a milky white complexion. And just as most guys from the other classes would say, St. Vincent Ferrer, Ritsuki and Michiko’s class, had the prettiest girls throughout St. Mathew, and Jin was one of the reason why. At Michiko’s left was Banjo, the one who had secretly admired Jin from behind her seat. Banjo was a naturally loud mouthed comedian, with his height, surprisingly thick glasses and an annoying mole, he was a laughing stock. Yet he was the one making the jokes on himself. On Banjo’s left was the snobbish Misato, she was a kind and gentle person in the inside and would gladly have a chat with you about anything under the sun. But most of the time, she’s on a bad mood, and does serious physical damage when provoked. On Michiko’s right was the goodie-goodie Eiji the smart and soft-spoken guy but a really dependable classmate when it comes to cheating. On Ritsuki’s right was Marina, the girl with really unpredictable mood swings that is pretty much dangerous at times. On her right was Ryu, Ritsuki’s buddy up front row. Ryu was as loud as Banjo but a more dependable comrade when it comes to cheating, Banjo is all the more serious when it comes to academics. It was enough reason for him to become the cream of the crop. That certain area of the class, 1st and 2nd row on the left panel, was a carnival of maroons. But it was where the fun starts at Ritsuki and Michiko’s Elementary school life…  
  
… to be continued.
