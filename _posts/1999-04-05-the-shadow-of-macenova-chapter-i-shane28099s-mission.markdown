CHAPTER-I: Shan’s Mission

Shan longed for an adventurous and a seemingly fluctuating experience, an adventure full of challenges and fun.  She never realized that this day would finally give her what she had always hoped for since then, she never knew her life’s about to change forever!  Shan’s turning 16 the following day and she was so excited about it.  And yet, people seem to have forgotten the very day she had prepared for.  Shan, as always, had been expecting some birthday greetings from her friends and family.  She loves getting attention from others, the slightest bit of acknowledgement would only make her day complete but the attention she had always craved for was from her secretly admired professor: Lezander Molt - the most talked about scholar in the Royal Academy of Ghislan Magic Arts (RAGAMA). For every moment of Master Molt’s tutorials, Shan would have her eyes glued on her good-looking professor. Watching his every movement, fantasizing about a romantic evening alone with him. However, Shan was not alone. A lot more other female students also crave for at least a moment of his time with them. Though Shan had always known it so, she never really cared. She wasn’t really THAT competitive anyway.  The sight of her professor alone could make her day complete.

Shan was a friendly mage in RAGAMA, she’s popular among students due to her mastery of  “barrier magic” she was the strongest anti-magic student in RAGAMA. However, she also was the weakest black mage in school, she has trouble casting a spell of magical “elements”.  As a result she was excluded in black magic lessons due to her uncommonly weak elemental spirit, but the weaker she is to black magic, the stronger she is in barrier related magic. She is currently an exclusive apprentice of Master Molt. Though Shan weren’t the only student of Master molt, she filled in Molt’s attention with her unique mastery of barrier magic. He has his eyes secretly spying this young and cheerful Shan.  For him, she was more like a mystery. Her unique misunderstanding to black magic & a questionable mastery of barrier magic is mysterious enough for him to be interested to. So this very day, he’s about to give a test for Shan in her final examination. 

“Have you heard?”  a friend asked Shan.

“Sir Molt had given Claire the dragon test!”

“Wwwwwwhat!?!”  Shan is now on a slight rage. Claire has always been Shan’s rival right from the start. 

“Claire is about to join 5 other black mages & healers as the teams Shieldeer! They’re about to explore this mountain to the north together with 2 ‘divine knights’ and search for the dragon elder Einhar!”  Shan’s friend, Aleah explained.

“Imagine, Claire hanging around with 2 cute & yummy divine knights! hers for the taking!”  Aleah followed.

“That’s unfair, Aleah!”  Shan exclaimed.


“We should be the ones in that team! I’ve been doing favors for him just to give us that test! Grrr…he’ll see!”  Shan said with bursting temper! Most students long to be in the team, the Dragon Test is held annually and is probably the only kind of test given outside Angelica.  


“Hey wait! What are you going to do?”  Aleah worriedly asked.

“I’ll just talk to that insensitive sophist!”  and Shan left her friend behind.

And so she did, she went to Molt’s house and knocked at the door as if she was about to break it down to pieces. But, when the door opened…

“Oh, um, is Master Molt there?”  Shan politely asked the person who opened the door.

“Well, the master is not here, he had escorted his student at the castle for, um, a test or something … I believe her name was… um, Claire! Right, it was Claire.”  The person said.

“Oh, well, thanks anyway, I think I’ll just follow him there.”  

“OK, he’ll probably be there ‘till tonight so you’ll  meet him for sure.” 

“OK, thanks a lot anyway (whew!)”  and Shan left.


So its off to the Mystical Castle of Angelica for Shan, her mission: To complain about his master’s insensitivity for not including her in the Dragon Mission Team.  But before Shan went off to the 30 minute horse- back ride to Angelica, she first looked for a companion, her friend Aleah, but she never saw her anywhere in Ghislan, no traces, as if she left the city to go somewhere important. So, Shan went off alone.  And as her horse named Shell Galloped through the road leading to Angelica, Shan thought of a couple of things. Now, she is 15, and tomorrow is her 16th birthday and she became excited.  And so she thought that if she asked this favor she wanted to Molt, chances are, Sir Molt might just grant this wish for her as a gift.  This plan’s just great for her that suddenly she smiled & laughed aloud.  Knowing that for sure, she’ll have what she wants.

Half a mile to Angelica, Shan saw the castle and said, “Wow! This castle gets better & better every time I see it, its just magnificent!”
She was amazed on how it looks on her point of view, it was like a swan swimming on a river of clouds. and as she went inside, 

“Well, then its time for the search!”

She looked around the castle grounds and searched for her master, and finally,


“Hey! Shan!” Claire shouted at her acting like an excited friend with good news.

“Claire?!”  Shan tried to ignore her but she figured, nothing can stop Claire from bluffing so she went down from Shell to accompany her. Claire was like a boastful self-centered hypocrite for Shan but she can’t ignore her. After all she’s her cousin.

“Hey I heard you were appointed as ‘Chemist’ by Master Molt, I’m happy for you.”  Shan said as if she wasn’t envious.

“Oh, how sweet of you, thanks (hugs)” Claire said thankfully.

“But you know, I wasn’t really that surprised. After all, I’m the best white mage in RAGAMA! Its only fair to appoint me as this year’s Dragon Mission Chemist! (giggles)” Shan slightly raised an eyebrow as she listens to Claire’s boasting!


And after quite sometime, a familiar voice called on the two,


“Hey there Shan! Claire! What’s up!”  It’s Aleah, and the two wondered.

“Aleah! Why are you here and what’s with the uniform!”  Aleah wore a uniform similar to Claire: a long sleeved blouse with magenta folds topped with a magenta vest with light brown scarf laced with gold and silver pattern on the edge, she wears a short magenta skirt with pleats and gold and silver lace. 

“Oh ,yeah, Master Molt told me that the team needed one more shieldeer and asked me if I wanted to join, well hey! There’s two divine knights we’re talking about here!, I won;’t miss this opportunity to the world, so I said yeees!”  Aleah said giggling.

“Grrrr!!!”

“Hey Shan what’s wrong?” Aleah asked.

“You’re asking me what’s wrong! You wanna know what’s wrong with me! HUH, ALEAH!!!”  Shan was out of control seemingly.

“Hey look Shan, Aleah got in! so that means they might also let you join, after all, you’re the best in barrier magic!” Claire said as if she wanted to cheer and cool the hotheaded Shan.

“Right! Shan, it will be fine, after all, Sir Molt knows you’ll be celebrating you’re 16th birthday tomorrow so he’ll probably won’t let you down so cheer up! “Aleah said.

“You guys must be right, I shouldn’t go berserk all the time”, said Shan.

“You said it! Haha!” Claire laughed.


So with a big smile, Shan faced her master, happy, as if she’ll be successful but…


“Oh, Shan!, what brings you here?” asked the gentle old Sir Lezander Molt.

“Er, umm, (teehee) I was just wondering sir…” said Shan.

“And what is that?”

“About the test you are suppose to give me…”

“Oh, that… umm… listen Shan, every body in my class wants to be in this Dragon Mission, and I know you are too, but they only need 2 shieldeer for now and I can’t put all of my shieldeers there! Kenji and Sol are in Angelica’s Magic Defense Team to test their magic barrier capabilities so I chose Gan and Aleah.” Molt explained.

“But what about me sir? You know I always wanted to be in this team! Am I not good enough?!” Shan asked with a long face.

“Shan, I have 10 black magic students, 6 white mages, 4 psychics and 5 support magic students, but you know what, you are the one that interests me most.” Shan blushed as Molt continues.

“I chose you as my exclusive apprentice because you’re exceptional! You are very good in barrier magic despite of your weakness in other types of magic. Have you ever wondered why? Have you ever asked yourself how come your elemental spirit is low and your barrier magic is splendid! If you ask me, I think you have a special mission. you have a role to play in your life and that role is what you need to discover.” Shan thinks deeper as Molt continues to clear his point.

“You see Shan, I want you to look for your purpose so I need you to go to Allona to discover yourself.”

“Wha…what, Allona?” Shan curiously asked.

“Meeting  King Juliam, the ruler of Allona is not as easy as it seems. You’ll know what I mean when you get there.” Said Molt.

“And my mission? …” asked Shan.

“That’s it! You’re about to face the King of Allona and give him this scroll.” Molt hands over a mysteriously looking scroll.

“What! Is that all?” asked Shan.

“Don’t think that this mission’s insensible, you’ll learn a lot here. If you fail however, you’ll never graduate and retain in being a senior, oh, and before I forgot, do not open the scroll until you reach the king. Remember, I can see your every movement but I am afraid that I can’t do anything to help you once you’re outside of Angelica!” Shan scratched her head and wondered.

“Where’s the challenge there!” she asked herself.


Suddenly she joins her friends once again.


“Well, what did the master say? Will we be in this team together?” asked Claire.
“I can’t believe this guy, he gave me a special test!” Shan said.

“What! What kind?” Aleah asked.

“Nothing! He gave me this silly test, to give this scroll to the King of Allona as fast as I can.” Shan said.

“Hey that’s unfair! You got the easiest!” Claire said slightly tapping Shan’s shoulder.

“And the most boring!” Shan followed.

“Yeah, you can just simply hop into the teleporter inside the castle which is directly connected to Allona!” Claire said as Aleah followed.

“Aren’t you the luckiest! You can even finish the test in just an hour.” She said.
Shan, however, is not happy. She always wanted an adventure to where she can use what Molt taught her, and she knew that being just a “messenger” won’t be fun.

“Hey, what’s wrong with you, Shan?” Claire asked.

“You should be happy, Molt doesn’t want you to be in danger, so, that must be why he chose this test for you”, she followed.

“(Envious) I still can’t believe it, it just proves that Shan’s his favorite student!” Aleah said. 

“Well, I still don’t know how this test would boost my skills!” Shan said as if she still hates her master’s chosen test for her.


After a while, Claire and Aleah then went to their respective formation together with the rest of the Dragon Mission Team. They were gathered as group and introduced themselves individually, they were briefed about the mission and were thought of some precautionary tactics lecture. As for Shan, she went back home in Ghislan. After the mission briefing, Claire and Aleah immediately went to Ghislan and gathered all of Shan’s friends to the top of their school building, and prepared a surprise for the jolly ol’ Shan.

“Okay, guys, we have five more hours till midnight! So let’s work as fast as we can, alright.” Aleah said to the crowd, and suddenly, all became busy. As for Shan…


“I just can’t believe my luck! It’s my birthday tomorrow and no one seem to care about it! Everybody’s busy on their oh-so-precious dragon mission!” Shan said to herself lying on her bed.

“All of my friends won’t be here tomorrow, even I, won’t be here tomorrow!, I’m leaving for this stupid mission and Sir Molt don’t care about the fact that it’s my BIRTHDAY! Why won’t he give what I wish for?”  Shan was somewhat emotional at this point. 

“Some Happy Birthday this is!”
           

Moments later, she fell asleep. Her dream… quite strange: She was dancing with a mysterious man with his face blurred. For a while, she thought it was Sir Molt so she was smiling , moments later it rained and they became wet, the air became romantic that she found herself kissing the man. She closes her eyes as if she was sensually turned on with the man’s kiss. Her feelings became intense then she held the man with both arms real tight. But, as she pauses and opened her eyes, the man laughed and laughed aloud with sinister voice. She suddenly recognized the face of the man and screamed with fear when she saw the man’s burning eyes, she attempted to let go, but she can’t take her hand tightly hugging the man. When suddenly, the rain turned red and became fire. She was burning to death but the man still laughs as if he had fooled someone. Luckily, Aleah woke her up and halted Shan’s nightmare.


“Hey! Shan, you were screaming to death!” Aleah said while Shan gathered air.

“I told you not to eat spicy foods before sleeping, look at you, you’re all white!” Aleah gave Shan a drink and let her breathe.

“I had a really bad dream,” Shan said huffing and puffing.

“It’s okay, it’s over now.” Aleah cheered her friend and talked to her a bit. It was an hour before midnight. Aleah told Shan that there’s a party going on at the school (RAGAMA) and that it’s about honoring someone. Shan was about to refuse but Aleah told her that Molt is there so she changed her mind and went to the school with Aleah. After climbing to the rooftop…

           
“SURPRISE!!! Happy Birthday!!!” and Shan was really surprised.

“Hey, you guys…  you shouldn’t have… (hehe) this IS a surprise indeed, thanks” and before Shan could become emotional, all greeted the surprised Shan and had a great time. 30minutes till midnight, Molt approached Shan and talked to her,

“Hi there Shan, Happy Birthday” Sir Molt said as he hands over his gift to her.

“Thank you Sir Molt, this is beautiful (a sapphire pendant) I’m very grateful.”

“Hey, stop calling me ‘SIR’ I’m only 4 years older than you and we’re not in class, so try calling me Lander for a change”, Molt said.


“Hmm okay, thank you… Lander, for this fabulous gift.”
