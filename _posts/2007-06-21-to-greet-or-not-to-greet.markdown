I did a little experiment yesterday. I was trying figure out who among my friends are thoughtful enough to greet me on my birthday, without me giving them a hint. Not that would hold a grudge to those who wont, afterall, there are a lot of excuses to choose from.. But I just want to know. Trip lang! eheh.

So here was the condition: Greeters can greet however they choose to greet me. Whether if it is an sms, email, im, personal greeting or phone call, It will be counted. The first greeting will be logged.

I also changed my online profiles to eliminate clues. ehehe. and so, here's the list:

**Analysis:

**I was actually hoping for it to reach 50, but these are enough to tell me that some people still remembers how to make me happy.

One of them even hid behind an unfamiliar ym name to add a little guessing game spice and greet me, she also said that she would greet me 100 times more if that would make me happy. eheh. Thanks.

One even gave me a gift, "Food for the Gods" she told me. I really appreciate the thought that she wanted me to feel like a god when I really do feel like shit. Thanks

One was a friend who never failed to greet me a single time on my day ever since we met. And even if we dont meet or talk that often, she still remembered. syaks. Thanks

My best bud and room bro even greeted me as i woke up. (yihi, bwehehe.) Thanks dod!

Too bad none of my band mates remembered (except for Perper). even from constant texting and chatting. darnit. (DAHIL JAN WALANG INUMAN! bwehehe jok.)

Also friends from abroad failed to greet me on time... Except for Nina who was actually here for vacation until july. The rest probably forgot.

Anyways, I'm really thankful that 31 people remembered. I dont feel bad about the rest who didn't, after all, Its just a greeting. but atleast, I know now, That I got these much thoughtful friends. Thanks a lot everyone.

PS. Andrama!? bwehehe.
