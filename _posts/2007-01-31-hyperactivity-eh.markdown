First off, my head hurts. I've been doing so many stuff lately that I only have about 4 hours to spend thinking about myself, and thats my travel time to and from work everyday! and to top it all off I had a really REALLY serious reprimand from motojime sakura this morning. syit.

Yep this is stress alright.

I have to stop the podcasting thing at the moment and concentrate on what really pays the bills... work. no more free stuff for now. ehehe. I can't afford to lose my job.

Also, I still have allergies from the drink we had at Slash's place yesterday when I lend my chords and effects to kittie for their gig. but its wearing off now, maybe because of the cold weather nowadays. I also, found out that we may have a battle coming this week and I haven't got my fingers on NC stuff... I had been pure EC this january. sheesh. I'm off to a hectic week again.

Oh yes, I noticed that I dont really blog much on this account lately, eheh. maybe I should merge by blogs then. So what if people who wasnt suppose to read it actually READ it!? i dont pakking care. ehehe. read it all ya want. I always address it to no one anyways.

Another thing that adds to my excitement is the meeting with some old friends. I am to meet with Mimi, zephyr and Teki for a web design tutorial and meet my old comrades at Darklight Oni and 2pe after. and on sunday, I am to meet a highschool friend for some mokey business. ehehe, reunion galore it is.

Oh well, lunch time is up and I gotta eat...
