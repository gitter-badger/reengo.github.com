I think its the time where we feel like we are useless... My PA takes forever to  approve... When would I get the adjustment that I long for? When would my family be satisfied with what I give? When would I see the light of day.. (andrama ampotah!) Is this stress? or am I just Craving for attention? KSP? emo? tsktsk... I feel like all things that I do are wasted efforts... cause people don't notice..

However, the drama between me and my sister really got me up fast. When my heart broke at home, as my family became insensitive,  I thought of leaving them for a few days to realize what I'm worth... but I realized that doing so had only made an emotional scar within my family. Thanks to a new face's advice, I decided to go home and restructure the house rules..

I then went back home from kittie's place on a sunday afternoon...

my mother saw me and did a million dollar smile, "ui.. hehe.. bat ngaun ka lang?"

I went inside the house... (if you call it a house)

my sister hugged me...

and then...

she cried...

A touching moment indeed, especially when she told me she missed me while tears falling down her eyes... (she really looks ugly when crying...)

and then...

I felt the guilt...

Kittie has been with me all throughout the emo week, and I thank her for keeping my sanity intact... I just hope that this feeling subside soon. I still need to keep working...
