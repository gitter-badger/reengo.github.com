Friday | 10:00pm

30 minutes before the time I should leave the office, A client was insistingly pushing me to finish his request... these guys were such a pain in the ass since day 1 but what else can i do, work is work. ehehe. right then I figured I wont be able to work on it on overtime so I decided to transfer the work to another developer. I left the office at around 6:30 and headed to Fairview QC riding an FX, the MRT, and a Jeepney ehehe. It took me about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get to the venue and boy did my cellphone get flooded! ehehe. I found my bandmates at the siopao eatery in front of Wilfredos Bar and then waited for our guests to arrive (Wilfredos require guests for quota per band).

While chatting with the organizers and some other bands, the guests finally arrived. Moonwalker, Yammie, and Roguerammer was there to volunteer and fill in the quota, then follows BGees unexpectedly to ruin my day... ehehe.

As we went inside I got the guest's free drink and listened to a few good indie music and helped the band tune up the instruments. Since we went inside Wilfredo's, 4 bands played ahead of us including the Adan Band which was Will's(our lead vocalist) former bandmates. They were such big help that night and we were really thankful that they were part of the lineup. ehehe. you guys are the best!

As we setup up on stage, lots of problems came about. Their friggin amps were not functioning well and the bass amp was volume swinging unintentionally. But anyways, we were still able to play our music. We played "Grasaman" the first time in an audience and it felt good. And well, only THAT song was played well in my opinion (ehehe).

After the gig, we went separate ways, Slash was asking for a drink at his place but I refused because I was so damn tired I am seeing bubbles all over the place. ehehe. I thanked the organizers, my band and guests then headed home for a good night sleep. I still got work the next day anyways. ehehe.

Grasaman
Neutral Caliber

I
Sikat ako sa aming bayan
Kilala ng kahit sino man
Ang lakas ng dating, akala mo pabling
Lahat lumilingon, tumitingin

Laging pinaguusapan
Gustong malaman ang pangalan
Sorry nalang, hindi ko rin alam
Pati pa nga aking pinanggalingan

Ref:
Sa bangketa nakahandusay
Napagkakamalang patay

Koro:
(Grasaman, grasaman) Ayaw mo akong lapitan
(Grasaman, grasaman) Di mo ko gustong kaibigan

II
Hindi ako naliligo
Hindi rin nag sisipilyo
Ang lakas ng putok, animoy sinuntok
Ang aking hininga amoy nabulok

Nanlilimahid sa langis
Ang anghit ko ay mabangis
Kilikili, maasim, balat ko ay itim
Libag ko ay isang dangkal narin

Ref:
Sa bangketa nakahandusay
Napagkakamalang patay

Koro:
(Grasa man, grasa man) Ayaw mo akong lapitan
(Grasa man, grasa man) Di mo ko gustong kaibigan
(Grasa man, grasa man) Salot daw ako

Bridge:
Nasaan ka kaibigan
Nasaan ka kapatiran
Nasaan ka kapit bahay
Nasaan ka aking nanay

Koro:
(Grasa man, grasa man) Ayaw mo akong lapitan
(Grasa man, grasa man) Di mo ko gustong kaibigan
(Grasa man, grasa man) Salot daw ako
