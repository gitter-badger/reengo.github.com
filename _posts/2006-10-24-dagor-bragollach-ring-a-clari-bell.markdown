Just this afternoon, the I"s staff recieved this box of Red Ribbon special mamon and pancit palabok from a mysterious guy who happens to be an admirer of one of our staff members. so mysterious that we are still not sure who the guy admires! or is he a she!? ehehehe. pakkit! a delivery guy from Red Ribbon appears at our front desk and leaves this box of goodies and a typewritten letter. The friggin letter says:



"ang mundo ko lilipas din ngunit hindi ang pagibig ko sa iyo mahal ko"

**evil grin**




Its an encrypted message on a large wierd font that we had to decode. of course the whole staff took part on it! ehehe. it was like Da Vinci Code's anagrams and stuff. but it was fun.

However, we have hunches on who those goodies are for. it was for our admin assistant Clars ehehe. the only question would be, who the heck is mister mystery? guys from the nearby Red Ribbon (possibly the place where he bought the goodies) have no clue whatsoever... drats... call up inspector gadget or something! ehehe.





He used the code name: "Dagor Bragollach" its a Sindarin Term (language artificially made by JRR Tolkien for the Lords of the Ring Series) for "The Battle of Sudden Flame". Clars' admirer would most likely be a LotR fan. Dagor Bragollach is only mentioned on the book and not the movies so I suppose the admirer is indeed an avid fan.

Paksyet! enough detective stuff. whoever that Dagor is he's got guts to make a move like that. and thanks for having us take part on the mamon feast! ehehe. But... I also have this feeling that maybe the admirer was actually one of the staff members! ehehe. who knows...
