Tomorrow is the start of a new career... a broader horizon for my frustratingly boring life... I could finally move on.

New environments await, new colleagues and office mates and a new work location to cope with. eheh. tomorrow I could fancy on new challenges that will end my boring freelance developer career. It could be boring as well and I'm crossing my fingers on unpleasant things but the excitement also gives me a sound relief. My freelancing could also take some time to lay low since I got very persistent clients and well... there's still a lot of issues to settle from my previous BS employer...

At least I get to look on a different perspective. Instead of managing people, planning and taking the blame for everything, and not to mention becoming a sacrificial lamb at times, I get to create the interesting projects my self, with my team mates... cool eh!?

BRING IT ON!!!
