The convention sucks... period.

Oh well, at least there was Sino Sikat? to jazz up the crowd...

Anyways, we still needed to make a report for this at the office so here it is...

Graphika Manila 2007, August 11, Saturday...

What really amused me the most on this year’s Graphika Manila Event was not the fancy artworks and the tools of the trade. It was the band Sino Sikat…! actually no. eheh. They had entertainment like this since I think they knew that their trying-hard-to-be comedian Host was too boring to give interest to the crowd. This year it was not about creating something cool. Rather, it was the ideas, the drive to think of something new. Passion is the most important ingredient on becoming creative.

This year’s presenters were great, big names in the print and multimedia design industry here and abroad was there to share their ideas, and of course, show off their skills eheh. What I don’t like however is the extensive time they allowed sponsors to speak and the limited time they offered to the actual speakers. HP for one had an awful lot of time demonstrating large format printers that I think they should demonstrate on printing companies and not the designers.

Asylum was one of the design company that I find most interesting, their work inspires me to consistently try something new. Something innovative and interesting which I think we should apply to most of our on going projects with ***Bleep*** or ***Bleep***. I suggest we try most other industries like music or fashion. Design projects concerning record companies or fashion boutique websites could really extend the creativity of our designers since they can freely use their imagination.

Electrolychee also oriented the attendees with a brief guide into how they work and how we should deal with traditional thinking clients (which i find interesting. eheh). It was really helpful to be aware of these things since we get to experience the exact same thing at the office.

It had been very educational attending this years Graphika Manila, however, I find the previous one better. It had been a great experience especially with the designers whom I share the same interests with.

....
yep... full of crap...
