Imagine having a bottle of 1.5 liters of coke inside your body... makes me dizzy just by the thought of it... damn...

My sister just had an Ovarian Cyst operation early this week. Finally, the uneasy feeling has come to an end. It took at least four (4) hours at the delivery room to get THAT thing out of her body and at least 3 hrs of stay at the recovery room. It was as if my sister has just delivered a baby!

It started when my sister had some irregular monthly periods which led to months of delay. Her checkup revealed that she had a huge ovarian cyst that is actually getting bigger and that she needed an operation. It was also sad that according to the Gynecologist, they would have to remove her left ovary which would lessen her chance of bearing a child (but still possible). Gyne: "We have to take this out immediately, if this pops it could lead to a shock that could be fatal".

After 3 opinions from different doctors and hospitals, the operation was a success! Thank God sis is safe... And to top it all off, Dra. Roselyn Navarro had actually found a way to save the left ovary! which was the best thing aside from the fact that nothing bad ever happened.

Dra. Navarro even showed us that damn cyst membrane and stretched it, it was like one huge bloody sausage skin with veins and all. The membrane contained that nasty 1.6 liters of liquid wrapping around the left ovary. The doctor managed to move around and tied a part the cyst sticking from the ovary, sucked out all the liquid before removing whats left of the cyst and fixed the stretched Falopian Tube in the process... disgustingly interesting...

All thanks to MaxiCare and Philhealth... a healthcare benefit from her employer.

Good riddance to the cyst and I hope it never comes back. Stay healthy sis and for goodness sakes, have a proper diet! nyahaha
