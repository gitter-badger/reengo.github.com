[![Jennifer Canopin, Singer, Musician.](http://www.reengo.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/profile.jpg)](http://www.reengo.com/jennifer-canopin-singer-musician-profile/profile)

As a child, Jennifer Canopin was already musically inclined and a singer at heart listening to rock music in the 80’s as well as classics from Asin, Juan Dela Cruz Band, Sampaguita, Freddie Aguilar, and The Eraserheads. The neighbor’s frequent playing of loud music also made her fond of songs from bands at an early age of 7 where she usually sings in front of a mirror using a comb as a microphone and a broom as an electric guitar, hoping and dreaming of becoming a rock star one day.

Jennifer Canopin started out singing as a backup singer on a Christian church at 13 years old and then the dream went on. Inevitably in high school, she got very much interested with bands listening to hit songs from Mojofly, Hungry Young Poets, Session Road, Moonstar 88 and other bands of the same era. Jennifer got so hooked that she desperately wanted to get into a band and perform. Eventually, she got what she wanted and joined a band named Gijena as a guitarist and backup vocals.

At 16, Jennifer Canopin’s band progressed quickly, winning championships on band tournaments across the city and some other out of town venues. Usually when the lead vocalist couldn’t come, Jennifer takes the stage as lead vocals and frequently wins the best vocalist award singing the songs “Nosi Balasi” by Sampaguita and “Sa Pagsikat ng Araw” by Dahong Palay.

Jennifer Canopin is a musician, particularly a singer influenced by pinoy rock music, funk, jazz, progressive, blues, reggae and ska. Jennifer loves listening to songs from Sampaguita, Asin, Juan Dela Cruz Band, Arnel Pineda, Sino Sikat, Session Road, Imago, General Luna, Katy Perry, Jewel, Anggun, Alanis Morissette, Pink, Save Ferris, No Doubt, Diana King, Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston, Roberta Flack, Anita Baker, Aerosmith, Guns and Roses, AC/DC, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Incubus, A Perfect Circle, Stone Temple Pilots, Pearl Jam, bob Marley, Heart, Joan Jett, Melissa Etheridge, Rage Against the Machine, Dream Theatre and many more.
