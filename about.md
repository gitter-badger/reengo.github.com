[![Reengo Banner](http://www.reengo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/reengobanner.jpg)](http://www.reengo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/reengobanner.jpg)

You have just landed on Reengo. Its an anything goes, Front End Ninja Gamer Blog sharing the adventures of an app developer and gaming enthusiast.

**Why Reengo?**

Reen is a old pseudonym I used in the days of the old. Its also an exaggerated spelling of my real name which you could obviously point out. Over the years, as the internet get stricter, not letting you choose a username lower than 6 characters. I basically began to use the name on a regular signup. This blog is mainly about my coding and gaming experiences and its a little difficult to think of a catchier name than Reengo, so… go figure. :D

What’s with the Code Monkey References?

It started with this song by Jonathan Coulton, a very inspiring song which I could relate very well to in the early days of my IT career. Unfortunately, code monkeys are also often referred to as programmers who does repetitive code, usually inexperienced developers who does all the boring stuff. Moving up to a point where I no longer need to call myself a code monkey, I still look back on how it was back then when all I could do, was follow what my boss tells me to do.
